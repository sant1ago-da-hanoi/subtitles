WEBVTT

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.750
I knew Harvey Dent,
I was his friend.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.830
and it was very long time before

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.430
someone inspires
us the way he did.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.160
I believed in Harvey Dent.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.520
- Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
- He wasn't alone.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.910
- You don't get to bring friends.
- There are not my friends.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.600
- Don't worry no charge for them.
- And why would I want them?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.100
They were trying to up your price.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200
They work for the mercenary,
a masked man.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.670
Bane?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.660
Get them on board.
I'll call them in.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.460
The flight plan
I just filed the agency,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.000
list me, my man, Dr Pavel here

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.570
but only one of you.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.400
The first one to talk get
to stay on my aircraft.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.870
Who paid you
to grab Dr. Pavel?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.160
I didn't fly so good,
who wants to try next?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.580
Tell me about Bane!
Why does he wear a mask?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.800
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.220
Or perhaps he was wondering
why someone would shoot a man

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.990
before throwing him out of the plane.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.890
At least you can talk. Who are you?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.800
It doesn't matter who we are.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.920
What matters is our plan.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.640
No one cared who I was
until I put on the mask.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.840
- If I pulled that off, will you die?
- It will be extremely painful ...

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.630
- You're a big guy.
- ... For you.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.720
Was getting caught part of your plan?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.810
Of course.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.590
Dr Pavel refused that offer
in favour of yours.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.490
We had to find out what he told you.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.310
Nothing! I said nothing!

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.040
Congratulations!
You got yourself caught!

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.890
Sir ...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.770
Now what's the next step
of your master plan?

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.670
Crashing this plane ...

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.560
...with no survivors.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.780
Mayday! Mayday!

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.730
No!

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.610
They expect one of us
in the wreck, brother.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.890
- Did we started the fire?
- Yes. The fire rises.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.670
Calm down, doctor.
Now this is not the time for fear.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.300
That comes later.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.950
Harvey Dent's day
may not be our oldest holiday

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.170
but we're here tonight because
it's one the most important.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.370
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.820
It made Gotham a safer place than
it was at the time of his death,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.730
eight years ago.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.720
This city has seen a
historical turn around

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.300
No city is without
crime but this city is

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.420
without organized
crime because of

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.020
the Dent's act gave law enforcement
teeth in it's fight against the Mafia.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.680
Now people are talking
about repealing the Dent's act

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.600
and to them I'll say not on my watch.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.070
I want to thank Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.570
Now I'm told that Mr. Wayne
couldn't be here tonight,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.430
but I'm sure that he's
with us in spirit.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.290
and now, I'm going to give away
to an important voice ...

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.720
Who can lay eyes on Wayne these days?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.770
No one has, not in years.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.900
People put in faith in a murderous
thug in a mask and a cape.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.420
A thug who shows his
true nature when

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.100
he betrayed the trust of this great
man and murdered him in cold blood.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.830
Sweetheart, what's so
fast with the chow?

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.640
Shrimp balls?

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.130
Jim Gordon can tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:57.730
Thank you.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.340
Let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon!

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.000
The truth ...

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:26.190
I have... a speech telling
the truth about Harvey Dent.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.130
Maybe the time isn't right.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.680
Maybe right now...

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.870
All you need to know is that ...

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.240
there are one thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.480
as a direct result of the Dent's act.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.450
These are violent criminals essential
thugs in the organized crime machine.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.950
Maybe, for now I should say about the
death of Harvey Dent's is this...

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.510
It has not been for nothing.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.790
Did you see the guy
who owns the house?

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.080
No. I heard he never
leaves the east wing.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.820
You know, I heard he had an accident.
Yeah that he's disfigured ...

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.860
Mr. Till! Why are your people
using the main staircase?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.730
- And where is Mrs. Bolton?
- She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.490
Get to the east wing.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.910
Unlock door, put the
tray on the table,

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.350
and lock the door again.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.640
Nothing more.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.370
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I tried
but he won't see you.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.520
You know, you mustn't
take it personally.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.310
Everyone knows that Wayne
is hold up in there with

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.310
8 inch nails paving into mason's jar

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.820
It's very good of you
to let me off the ground.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.920
Why are you wasting your
time trying to talk

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.570
to a man who throw
away your investment

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.350
on some save the world vanity project?

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.930
He can't get your
money back, I can.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.340
I could try explaining that
the save the world project,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.260
vain or not, is worth investing in,
Mr. Daggett.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.780
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.300
So why waste my time, indeed?

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.970
Second report shift report's in,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.600
You should spend some
time with the mayor.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.310
Well that's your department.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.130
Did anyone shows him
the crime stats?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.300
He goes by his guts,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.600
and it continues to bothers him
no matter what the numbers.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.100
Must be popular with his wife.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.700
Not really. He took the kids
and left for Cleveland.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.410
We have plenty of time for visits.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.700
The Mayor going to dump
him in the spring.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.890
Really? But he's a hero.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.580
War hero. This is peace time.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.640
Sorry sorry.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.580
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne!

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.240
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.420
Although you don't have
long nails or facial scars sir...

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.670
That's what they say about me?

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.050
Because you know,
no one ever sees you.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.580
That's a beautiful necklace!

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.110
Reminds me of one that
belongs to my mother.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.840
It can't be the same one,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.380
because her Pearls are in the safe.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:02.210
The manufacturer clearly
explained that it is uncrackable.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.960
Nobody told me
it was uncrackable.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.440
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.800
Look you wouldn't
beat up a woman,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.160
anymore than I would
beat up a cripple.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.290
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.830
Good night, Mr. Wayne!

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.440
- Can I have a ride?
- You read my mind!

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.480
Let's go!

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.810
Ms. Tate was asking to see you again.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.110
- She's very persistent.
- And quite lovely.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.330
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.170
- What are you doing?
- Examining print dust.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.940
We've been robbed.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.180
And this your idea of a..
sounding the alarm, is it?

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.390
She took pearls,
tracking device and all.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.990
- She?
- One of the maids.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.990
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this part of the house.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.530
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:24.810
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't. She does.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.670
Sir! Congressman Gilly's
wife been calling

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.340
in apparently the
congressman never made

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.610
it home after the Wayne
Foundation event.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.610
That's the job for the police.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.330
When you and Dent clean up the
streets, you've cleaned them good.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.470
Pretty soon we will be chasing
down an over due library books.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:51.560
and yet, here you're act
like we're still at war.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.380
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.170
You have something you
want to ask me officer Blake?

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.080
It's about that night, this night,
eight years ago, the night Dent died.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.580
The last confirm sighting
of The Batman.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.340
Who murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.660
brakes Dent's neck
and then just vanishes.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.220
I'm not hearing the question.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.790
Don't you want to know who he was?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.780
I know exactly who he was.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.800
He was The Batman.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.370
Let's go see about
The Congressman's wife.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.860
Master Wayne!

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.500
Master Wayne!

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.870
You haven't been down
here in a long time.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.550
I'm trying to finding more
about our jewel thief.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.000
I ran her prints.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.030
Unless she loss a lot of weight,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.480
she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.740
She's good.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.060
She may be, but we
a..trace on the necklace.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.040
We do, so I cross reference
the address she went back to,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.960
with police data on high
end thieves and these

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.040
and Selina Kyle.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:44.510
Her database’s are full of close
calls and tips around the fences.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.420
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.180
We should send the police
before she fences her purposes.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.700
She won't. She likes it too much
and they weren't what she was after.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.880
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.100
I was printer toner mixed with
graphite on the safe.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.790
It gives you good pull
and and it's untraceable.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.730
Fascinating! You two should
exchanging notes over coffee.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.810
So you're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.960
At this point, I'd set you
up with a chimpanzee,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.760
if it'd bring you back to the world.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.890
- There's nothing out there for me.
- And that's the problem.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.630
You hung up your cape and your
mask but you didn't move on.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.190
You never went to find a life,
you'll find somehow...

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.190
Alfred ...

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.560
I did find someone.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.680
I know, and you lost them
but that's all part of living sir.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.190
But you're not living,

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.900
you are just waiting, hoping
things to go bad again.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.050
Remember when you left Gotham?

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.020
Before all this,
before Batman,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.070
You've been gone for seven years.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.780
Seven years I've waited
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.200
Every year, I took a holiday.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.910
I went to Florence's cafe
on the banks of the Arno.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.890
Every fine evening, I'll sit there
and ordered a Fernet Branca.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.950
I had this fantasy..

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.970
that I would look across the
tables ... and I'll see you there ...

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.490
... With a wife maybe
a couple of kids.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:16.110
You won't say anything
to me, nor me to you.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:23.120
But we both know that you made it,
that you were happy.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.270
I never wanted you to
come back to Gotham.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.720
I always know that
there was nothing

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.270
else here for you except
pain and tragedy

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.480
and I wanted something
more for you than that.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.580
I still do.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.490
It washed up here a
couples of times a month

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.290
even more when it gets colder.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.290
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.390
We pulled him from the base but
other than that, we didn't touch it.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.660
What?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.780
His name is Jimmy.
He's from St. Swithin's.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.230
He's the boy on my school.
I coached the ball.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.790
Jimmy has not been around for months.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.000
- No, why?
- Blake, you know why.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.610
He aged out.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.520
We don't have the resources
to keep the boys on after 16.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.830
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for them.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.630
Not for the past couple of years.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.140
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.040
I'd like to. If that's alright.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.440
You know what he was
doing down there in the tunnels?

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.950
A lot of guys go in down in the
tunnels when they aged out.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.050
They said he lived down there.
They says there's work down there.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.760
Work?

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.570
What kind of work you
can find in the sewers?

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.070
More than you can
find out here I guess.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.060
- So you know about him.
- Of course.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.460
Do you think he's coming back?

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.170
I don't know...

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.400
You brought a date?

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.110
I like someone around
to open doors for me.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.020
Right hand, I got partials.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.230
Very nice!

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.640
Not so fast, handsome!
You've got something for me?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.040
Oh yes.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.170
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:59.080
but I'm guessing, you need his thumb.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.980
- You don't count so good huh?
- I count fine.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.780
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.800
Okay ...

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.960
My friend's outside, just...hit send.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.900
- This place is a little dim.
- I'll light up in a minute. Trust me.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.790
Is everything okay?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.190
Great. Catch you later.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.500
It would've been a lot easier to
just give me what we agreed.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.510
We can't have loose ends.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.220
and even in that dress,
no one going to miss you.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.730
No but my friend over there,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.130
Every cop in the city is missing him.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.580
That's cute! But they're not going
to be looking in a place like this.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.120
I don't know,
you did use your cell phone.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.590
Police! Get down now!

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.000
Help me!

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.170
Keep some pressure
on that, sweetheart.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.280
Call me?

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.940
- Careful, Miss.
- He's bleeding! You gotta help him!

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.040
I've got The Congressman.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.450
There!

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.440
The manhole! Get this out.
Get the GWPD down here!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.900
You three, down with me!

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.850
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.140
What? He went down there?

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.770
- We're going down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.290
What gas? It's a sewer.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.440
No one goes in there until
we know what's down there.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.380
We know who's there sir,
a police commissioner.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.430
Someone get this hot head out of here.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.730
and where's that GWP guy?

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.970
Why are you here?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.330
Answer him!

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.810
I was asking you.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.600
It's a Police Commissioner.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.640
- And you brought him down here?
- We didn't know what to do.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.410
- We just thought ...
- You panicked.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.410
And your weakness cost
the lives of three others.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.030
No. He's a little ...

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.590
Search him. Then I'll kill you.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.480
He's dead!

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.370
So show me his body!

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.660
The water runs to any
one of the out flows.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.740
We'll never find him.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.190
- Follow him.
- Follow him?

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.870
Detective! Detective! Hey!

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.510
Hey! You awake?

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.140
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.840
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.040
even from a police officer.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.650
If I go get a warrant for the
investigation of Harvey Dent's murder,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.450
it still counts as an unscheduled?

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.770
How can I do for you officer?

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.630
Commissioner Gordon been shot.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.310
He chased a gun man down in the sewers.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.760
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army,

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.510
a masked man called Bane.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.810
Shouldn't you be telling this to
your superiors officers about this?

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.430
They asked if he saw
any giant alligators.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.220
He needs you.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.300
He needs The Batman.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.450
Commissioner Gordon thinks ...

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.120
Oh he doesn't know.
He didn't care who you are.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.440
But we met before.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:23.170
There was a long ago,
I was a kid at St. Swithin's ...

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.640
Used to funded by The
Wayne Foundation.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.790
It's an orphanage.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.380
My mother died when I
was small in a car accident.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.080
But I don't remember it.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.930
My dad got shot a
couple of years later

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.050
for a gambling debt.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.970
Oh I remember that one just fine.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:50.960
Not a lot of people knows what it
feels like to be angry in your bones.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.930
I mean they understand.
The fosters parents.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.310
Everybody understands ...

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.290
... For a while.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.880
Then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.750
move on.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.940
After a while they stop understanding.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.830
They send the angry little
kid to a boy's school.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.650
I figured it out too late.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.640
You got to learn to hide the anger,
practice smiling in the mirror.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.090
It's like putting on a mask.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.010
So you show up this one
day, in a cool car,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.220
pretty girl in your arms.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:35.150
You were so excited!
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan?

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.770
We used to make up stories
about you man, legends ...

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.590
and you know the other kids,
that's all it was, it's just stories.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.040
But when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.910
I seen that look on your face before.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.150
It's the same one that
I taught myself.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.230
I don't why you take the
fault of Dent's murder

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.610
but I still a believer in The Batman.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.880
Even if you're not...

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.420
Why did you say that
your boy's home

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.230
used to be funded by
The Wayne Foundation?

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.070
Because the money stopped.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.120
About time to get some fresh air

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.810
and start paying attention
to the details.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.610
Some of that details
might need your help.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.920
Have you checked that name, Bane?

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.310
He's a mercenary.
No names.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.250
He and he's man were
behind a coup in West Africa.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.320
They've secured a mining operations
for our friend, John Daggett.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.280
- And Daggett brought them here.
- So it seems.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.920
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.240
Alfred, why did The
Wayne Foundation

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.630
stopped funding the
boy's home in the city?

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:55.200
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne Enterprises.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.100
There have to be some ...

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.520
Time to talk to Mr. Fox I think.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.310
I'll get him on the phone.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.690
No. Did we still have any
car around the place?

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.730
Yes, one or two

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.930
I need an appointment at
a hospital for my leg.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.500
- Which hospital?
- Which ever one Jim Gordon's in.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.620
I've seen worst cartilage in knees.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.820
- It's a good?
- No.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.530
That's because there's no
cartilage in your knees

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.550
and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.030
Between that and scar
tissue on your kidney,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.520
residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.260
and the general scar over
quality of your body,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.700
I cannot recommend you to
go heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.180
Right.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:58.360
We're in this together.
I thought you were gone.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.770
The Batman wasn't needed
anymore. We won...

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.080
We strung a lie.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:11.290
Now there's evil rises again
where we try to bury him.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:15.580
The Batman has to come back.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.690
And if he doesn't exist anymore?

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:25.180
He must. You ...

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.980
<i> You got them wallet, do you? </i>

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.880
- You took my wallet!
- No I didn't!

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.780
- Get out!
- She took my wallet...

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.310
Now!

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.200
Crazy!

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.570
I don't know why he's so upset
about. It's only 60 bucks in here.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.300
You got to wear the watch.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.310
Who's that?

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:10.340
Another stiff convety climb
out of his sport car.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.450
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.830
Bruce Wayne, over here!

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.740
- I'm not sure if my assistant ...
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.860
Thank you so much.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.040
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.110
Ms. Tate, is it not?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.850
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these events.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.110
Proceeds goes to big fat spread.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.180
This is not about charity.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.050
It's about feeding the ego which
ever society hag laid this on.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.920
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.830
And the proceeds will go
where they should,

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.360
because I paid for the big
fat spread myself.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.030
You spread generously?

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.470
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.340
Take our clean energy project.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.110
Sometimes, the investments
just doesn't pay off.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.720
I'm sorry.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.420
You have a practiced
absent, Mr. Wayne.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.760
But a man who does not care about the
world doesn’t spend half his fortune

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.010
on a plan to save it.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:24.030
And isn't so wounded when it's
fail but he goes into hiding

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.920
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne!

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.230
Mind if I cut in?

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.750
Thank you.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.270
You're don't seem happy to see me.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.810
- You're suppose to be a shut-in.
- I felt like some fresh air.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.620
Why didn't you called the police?

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.990
I have a powerful friend who
deals with things like these.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.860
It's a brazing costume
for a cat burglar.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:59.280
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.300
- Who's your date?
- His wife is in Ibiza.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.200
She left her diamonds behind
though, worried it might get stolen.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.560
It pronounced 'Ibitha'.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.990
You wouldn't want any of these folks
realizing you're a crook now.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.820
Social planner.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.620
You think I care what everyone
in this rooms thinks of me?

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.230
I doubt you care anyone in
any room who thinks of you.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.210
Don't candescent, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know me a thing about me.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.650
Well Selina Kyle.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.860
I know you came here from
your walk-out Old Town,

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.780
a modest place for a
master jewel thief.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.060
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.590
or you in deep with
the wrong people.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.420
You don't to get judge
just because you

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.630
were born the master
bedroom of Wayne....

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.100
Actually, I was born in
the Regency room.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.770
I started out doing what I had to.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.620
Once you're done
what you had to,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.490
They never let you do
what you wanted to.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.300
Start fresh.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.330
There's no fresh start
in today's world.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.340
Any 12 years with a cell phone
would find out what you did.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.560
Everything we do is collated
and quantified everything sticks.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.210
Is that how you justify stealing?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.920
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.160
I don't stand on the shoulders
of the people with less.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.330
Robin Hood?

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.410
I think I do more to help someone
than most of the people in this room.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.070
Than you.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.770
I think maybe you're
assuming a little too much.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.270
Maybe you're being
unrealistic about what's

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.510
really in your pants
other than wallets.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.070
Ouch.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.650
You think all this can last?

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.650
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.050
You and your friends better
battered down the hatches.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.460
Because when it hits,
you're all going to wonder

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.130
you could ever thought
you could live so large

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.150
and leave so little
for the rest of us.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.460
You sound like you're
looking forward to it.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.760
I'm adaptable.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.560
Those pearls do look better
on you than it did in my safe,

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.540
but I still can't let you keep them.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.390
You scared her off!

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.880
Not likely ...

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.900
I still lost my ticket.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.100
Your wife said you're
taking the cab home.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.630
My wife?

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.890
Just you, sir?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.890
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.130
Takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.060
Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.990
What brings you out of
prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.620
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.200
even if you have lost
most of my money.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.920
Actually you did that.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.840
If you follow all your
entire RND budget

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.820
to a fusion project
that you get mock more.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.970
Your company is unlikely to thrive.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.700
What are the options?

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.020
Well if you're not unwilling
to turn on the machine,

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.670
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.800
Well then sit tight.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.730
Your majority keep dagger at bay

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.210
while we figured out a future for the
energy program with Miranda Tate.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.150
She has supported the
project all the way.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.690
She's smart and quite lovely.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.930
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.320
- Show her the machine.
- I think it over.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:35.210
- Anything else?
- Nope. Why?

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.700
Well these conversation used to
end with an unusual request.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.040
I retired.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.010
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.970
Just for old times' sake.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.970
I figured you had to
shut this place down.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.660
Oh, it was always shut down.
Officially.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.180
What's the new stuff ...

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.490
After your father died,
Wayne Enterprises

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.960
has set up 14 different
defense subsidiaries.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.520
For years, I've been
shuttering and consolidating

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.740
all the different prototypes
under one roof.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.820
- My roof.
- Why?

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.760
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.510
Now you just showing off.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.060
It's a defense department project.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.560
Tight Geometer Urban Pacification.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.040
Rotors are configured to
maneuver between buildings

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.500
without recirculation.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.640
What it's call?

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.150
It has a long uninteresting
Wayne Enterprise’s designation.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.680
I just the took of calling it The Bat.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.560
And yes Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:52.200
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.390
Takes a better mind
than mine to fix it.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.030
A better mind?

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.360
Well I was trying to be modest.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.460
A less busy mind, yours.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.380
It should be a bit painful.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.180
You'll be very welcome to try, Alfred.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.280
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.300
Not bad ...

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.880
Not bad at all!

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.980
If you're seriously considering
going back out there,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.490
you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.290
I'm all ears.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.690
There is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:47.780
A pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.680
But sometimes a man
rises from the darkness.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.880
Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.380
- Bane!
- Right.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.380
Born and raised in hell on earth.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.580
Born in a prison?

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.390
No one knows why or how he escaped.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:12.460
But they do know once he did, he was
trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.050
Bane was a member of
The League of Shadows.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.410
And then he was excommunicated.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.330
And any man who is too
extreme for Ra's Al Ghul,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.520
is not to be trifled with.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.320
I didn't realized I  was known
for trifling with criminals.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:28.960
That was then.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.330
Then you can just strap up your
leg and put your mask back on,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.510
but that doesn't make
you what you were.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.640
If this man is everything what you
say he is, then the city ??need me.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.960
The city needs Bruce Wayne,
your resources, your knowledge.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.110
It doesn't need your
body or your life.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.200
That times has past.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.480
You're afraid if I go back
out there, I'll fail.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.340
No.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.760
I'm afraid that you want to.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.260
You can't short the stock if
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.730
Wayne's coming back has change.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.430
- Changes, is it good or bad?
- I vote bad.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.460
- On what basis?
- I flip the coin.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.740
I said no rye man.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.930
Rookie! Loose the helmet!
We need faces for camera.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.130
Come on let's go scalping.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:50.370
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.080
Really? Then why are you people here?

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.010
You got to get in there!

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.110
- It's a hostage situation.
- No! This is a robbery!

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.420
They have direct access to
the online trading desk.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.930
I'm not risking my men
for your money.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.730
Sir, you going to ask you to move.
We have a situation here.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.920
It's not our money,
it's everybody's.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.190
Really? Mine is in my mattress.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.600
If don't put these guys down,

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:43.030
that something in your mattress maybe
be worth a whole hell of a lot less.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.450
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.650
- Thank you.
- That will slow them down.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.420
They cut the Fiber.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.860
- The cell's working.
- For now.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.100
Get all this barriers up.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:06.970
I want all of them up.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.600
No one gets in or out of
any of these streets.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.990
- Where am I suppose to move it?
- Back it up.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.570
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.440
How much longer does
the program needs?

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.230
Eight minutes.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.520
Time to go move out.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.070
Everybody up!

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.650
You two, move!

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.890
Thank you.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:46.560
Steady!

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.940
Steady!

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.560
I got something!

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.300
Do not shoot! We've hostages!

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:10.950
Hold your fire!

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.090
Go! Go!

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.430
Hey, let me go!

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.810
Please! Hey!

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.650
- Shoot the tires!
- There's no shot.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.140
Now back off! Back off!
They've got hostages!

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:49.290
<i>Police are pursuing
the 4 suspects from</i>

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.460
<i>downtown in respond to
a hostage situation</i>

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.690
Gotham PD...

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.660
What's going on with the lights?

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.320
I can't pick up anything!

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.470
Who the hell was that?

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.880
Oh boy you're in for
a show tonight, son!

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.880
Please! Help!

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.440
Sorry!

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.040
Put that thing away before
you hurt yourself.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:43.640
Get in!

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.640
Let's go. You, get in the car!

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.640
We've spotted The Batman!

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.230
I want all everyone in.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.530
Every car patrol, street
cops and off duty too.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.830
Call them in now!

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.630
I'm going to do what
Jim Gordon never could.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.520
- What's that?
- I'm going to take down The Batman.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.910
<i>..the 4 suspect are
carrying two hostages</i>

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.090
<i>that they kidnapped them at
the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.860
<i>Witnesses reported that ...</i>

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.150
<i>It seems hard to believe.</i>

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:21.870
<i>But report are suspects
are now being pursued,</i>

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.720
<i>what appears to be, The Batman.</i>

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.020
Well, what do you know?

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.640
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.520
Please! Let me go! Please!

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.560
<i> One bike has pulled off. </i>

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.650
<i> No hostage. Shall we pursue? </i>

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.750
Negative. Stay on The Batman!

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.800
- He's getting away.
- Who do you want to catch huh?

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.820
Some robber or the son-of-a-bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.930
Eight years and he
has to pick tonight.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.470
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.890
Please! Just let me go! Please!

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.680
TRANSFERRING COMPLETE

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.880
<i> We lost him. </i>

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.830
How could you lose him?

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.330
<i> He's got a lot of firepower. </i>

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.630
And what? You don't?

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.580
<i> He heads back downtown. </i>

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.570
and he's as dumb as he dresses.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.650
Close it up, gentlemen!

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:41.800
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.220
I might've the wrong
animal there, sir!

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.610
You're sure it was him?

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.550
<i> Bane says that Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished. </i>

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.330
What about the men they've arrested?

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:19.140
He said and I quote:
' They would die before talking. '

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.640
Where does he finds these guys?

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.770
Open the champagne!

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:32.000
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Be careful what you wish for!

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.450
- Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch!

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.700
Nobody ever accuse of being dumb.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.360
You're dumb, for coming here tonight.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.110
I want what you owe me.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.880
- One doesn't get ...
- Nice outfit!

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.010
Aren't those heels make
it tough to walk?

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:05.910
I don't know, do you think?

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.610
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.110
The program ' The Clean Slate '.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.680
The Ultimate Tool for a
master thief with a record.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.860
Hold it right there!

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.900
- Where is it?!
- ' The Clean Slate? '

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:35.970
When you type in someone's
name, date of birth

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:40.500
and a few minutes they're gone,
every database on earth.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.810
Sounds a little too good to be true?

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:46.520
You're lying! RIKEN DATA took
it to the prototype stage.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.060
That's why I bought them.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:54.700
But they had nothing.
It was a gang-land myth.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.180
Stay back!

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.960
I'm not bluffing!

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:15.230
They know! They just don't care.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.100
- You got to be kidding me.
- No guns, no killing.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.750
Where the fun in that?

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.040
My mother warned about getting
into cars with strange men.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.250
This isn't a car.

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:50.790
You're welcome!

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.890
- I had it under control.
- Those weren't street thugs.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.550
They were trained killers.
I saved your life.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.340
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:05.850
Wayne wasn't kidding
about a powerful friend.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.980
I sold his prints to Daggett.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.830
Something that doesn't even exist.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.150
I doubt that will get the
better of you.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.320
- Hey when a girl's desperate...
- What's he going to do with them?

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:20.310
I don't know but
Dagget seem pretty

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.650
interested in that mess
at the stock market.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.210
Miss Kyle ...

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.190
So that's what that feels like...

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.080
I seen you in the
television coverage,

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.770
you've got your taste for
wanting destruction back.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:00.570
There are 3 disks.

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:03.480
Aren't the police suppose
to be investigating them?

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.390
They don't have the
tools to analyze it.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.090
They would if you gave it to them.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.780
One man's tool is another man weapon.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.750
In your mind perhaps,

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.090
but there aren't many things
can't turn into a weapons.

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.190
Alfred, enough!
The police weren't getting it done

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.490
Maybe they might have. If you hadn't
made the side show of yourself.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.090
You I didn't had it in me.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.390
No! You got to glow at the
police force, a married chased

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.690
with a lot of fancy
new toys from Fox's.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.500
What about when you
come up against him?

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.690
What then?

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:29.890
I'll fight harder. I always have.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.780
Take a look, his speed,
his ferocity, his training.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.390
I see the power of believe.

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.580
I see The League of Shadows insurgent.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.280
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's Al Ghul.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.580
Who leads them now?

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.980
Ra's Al Ghul was The League
of Shadows and I beat him.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.880
Bane is just a mercenary,
we need to find out what he's up to.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.560
Trade of some kind. Coded.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.570
And my fingerprints
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:59.680
Give this to Fox.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:01.160
He can crack the code

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.220
and tell us what trades
they were executing.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.550
I'll give this to Mr. Fox but no more.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:16.970
I sewed you up, I set your
bums but I wont bury you.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:21.020
I buried enough members in
The Wayne family.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.210
You're leaving me?

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:26.250
You see only one end
to your journey.

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:31.220
Leaving is all I have to
make you understand.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.070
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.570
You used to talked about finishing
about a light on that awful cave.

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.250
Alfred, Rachel died knowing
that we had decided to be together.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.980
That was my life,
beyond the cave.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.650
I can't just move on.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.300
She didn't, she couldn't have.

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:54.560
- What did she had?
- You know I can't change that.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.710
And if, before she died,
she wrote a letter

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.200
saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:10.230
And what if to spare your pain....

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.380
I burned that letter ...?

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:18.850
How dare you use Rachel
to try and stop me.

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:22.100
I am using to choose
Master Wayne.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:25.430
Maybe it's time we all start
trying to out smart the truth

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.980
and let it have it stay.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.450
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.020
You expect to destroy my world ...

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:39.520
... and then think we're
going to shake hands?

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.640
No.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.630
- I know what this means.
- What is it means?

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.400
It means your hatred and it
also mean losing someone.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.740
Who I've cared kept
for since I first heard

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:59.500
his cries echoes through this house.

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:04.900
But it might also mean
saving your life.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.860
And that's more important.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:15.290
Good bye, Alfred!

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.210
Alfred?

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.490
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.750
Page three.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.040
Seem you made a series a laud of
put options on the future exchange.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:51.680
Verified by thumb print.

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:54.260
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.660
Long term we may be able to prove
it was a fraud but for now,

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.100
you're completely broke.

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.970
and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.550
The weapons ...

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.050
We can't let Daggett get his
hands on the applied sciences.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.190
Applied sciences is all lock
up and off the books.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.380
The energy project however
is a different story.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.270
Miranda Tate ...

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.050
We need to convince the
board to get behind her.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.200
Let's show her the reactor.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.730
We're meeting her there in 35
minutes so you better get dressed.

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.900
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?
We're meeting her there in 35
minutes so you better get dressed.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.980
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.940
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.490
Please keep hands and
feet in the car at all time.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.020
This is it, isn't it?

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:46.130
The reactor is beneath the river

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.790
So it can be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:54.860
Is Bruce Wayne
really that paranoid?

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.600
I fail to give an answer on that one.

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.090
I thought you might like to see
what your investment builds.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:11.530
No fossil fuels, free clean
energy for an entire city!

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.040
Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.940
a paper on weaponize
fusion reactions.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:23.260
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.800
I think this machine works.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:32.750
Miranda, if it were operational,
danger to Gotham would be too great.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.130
Would it make you feel better
to know that the Russian

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:39.000
scientist died in a plane
crash six months ago?

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:42.790
Someone been working
hard with Dr. Pavel.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.920
Someone will figured
out the way for make

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.940
this power source into
a nuclear weapon.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:56.590
I need you to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.140
- To do what with it?
- Nothing.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.680
- Until we can guarantee it's safety.
- And if we can't?

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:05.460
Decommission it, flood it.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.420
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.220
The world is not ready, yes.

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:15.700
Bruce, if you want to save the world
you have to start trusting it.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:16.810
I'm trust you.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:19.460
It doesn't count.
You have no choice.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:22.610
I could've flooded this chamber at
any time in the last three years.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:26.950
I'm choosing to trust you. Please ...

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.380
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
this meeting will now come to order.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.570
You know, I would like to point out that
we have a non-board member here.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:45.260
There is highly irregular, even if
his name is above the door.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.570
Bruce Wayne's family
built this company.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.750
- and he himself has run it ...
- Into the ground, sir!

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:52.950
Does anybody disagrees?

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.350
Check the share prices this morning.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:59.610
Crazy gambling on future not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat,

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.950
it has cost us all a lot of
money and he has to go.

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.140
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.240
Well back to business.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.640
How does it feel to be
one of the people, Wayne?

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.540
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car..

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
I didn't know that you're
off the board.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.550
Looks like you'll need a ride huh?

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.330
Mr. Wayne, will you get a ride?

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.240
What the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne Board?

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.790
I mean, is she been meeting with him?
Is she been sleeping with him?

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:37.540
Not that we know of.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.660
Oh clearly you don't know much
of anything, do you? Where's Bane?

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.080
- You told him it was urgent.
- Where is that man now?

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.700
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appears.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.860
What the hell is going on?

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.000
The plan is preceding as expected.

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:57.130
Really? Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.110
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work my friend.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.820
And now you have my
construction crews

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.980
going around the city
at 24 hours a day.

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:12.620
How exactly is that suppose to help
my company absorbs Wayne?

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:17.270
- Leave us!
- No! Stay here!

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.980
I'm in charge here.

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:23.040
Do you feel in charge?

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.840
I have paid you a small fortune.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.240
And this gives you power over me?

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.970
What is this?

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:39.470
Your money and infrastructure
have been important ...

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.110
... until now.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:44.270
- What are you?
- I'm Gotham reckoning.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.860
It'll end of all the damn
you've been living on.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.490
You are pure evil.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.550
- A necessary evil.
- No!

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:04.200
Well you've started quite a mess.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.060
To protect the people closes to me.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.000
Maybe you're a loner, right?
You didn't have a family.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.100
There are always people
that you care about.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.660
But you didn't realize how
much until they're gone.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.630
The idea was to be a symbol.

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:23.060
Batman can be anyone.
That was the point.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.440
- Well it damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.220
I'll figured that out in the end.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.980
Do you got anything on
Bane's whereabouts?

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.670
Yes, I have 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight.

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:36.480
I could use some help actually.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.770
You know what,
drop me in the old town.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.930
<i> - I don't think so!
- That is not how it works. </i>

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.080
He's not a mark.

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:51.940
and he doesn't have a
cent to his name anyway.

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:56.730
Yeah. It's not much, but it's
more than you got right now.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.700
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.490
The rich doesn't even go
broke like the rest of us huh?

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.720
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:09.280
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.500
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.350
- He wants to meet tonight.
- Why?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.530
He needs to find Bane.
He says you know how.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.560
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay. I like your place.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.130
Mr. Wayne!

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.590
I'm sorry they took all your money.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.140
No you're not.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:39.980
- Can we help you officer?
- Yeah.

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:42.910
John Daggett's body was found
in a dumpster an hour ago.

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.380
Thought you might wanna know.

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.530
Why?

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.360
Well his name is all
over this permit I just

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.030
pulled to half the
tunnel under Gotham.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:54.210
That's MTA maintenance, sewer
construction and others things...

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.550
What did you get with the
tunnel searches?

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.870
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hot heads out.

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.900
We had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.570
Well get more then.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.610
Work the grid.
I want him found.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.060
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.990
Lose the uniform.
You’re working for me now.

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:14.530
We could some hot head around here.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.390
Sir, Daggett's death could
only be a coincidence.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.270
You're a detective now, son.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.240
You're not allowed to believe in
coincidences anymore.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.430
- Nobody's answering.
- No ...

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.750
- I'm on my own now.
- Do you have keys?

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:43.230
I never needed them.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.810
I hope you didn't liked
reaching my money.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.160
Suffering this character.

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.870
I'll take care of your
parents legacy, Bruce.

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:07.470
Who's this?

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.280
Where is Alfred?

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.490
He left.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.700
...taking everything...

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.650
- What's that?
- Our power has been shut off.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.860
You're good at that.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.970
When I was a child, we
had almost nothing.

01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:07.880
But on the nights when we had
a fire, We felt very rich indeed...

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:12.310
I assumed your family was wealthy.

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.810
Not always not when I was young.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:22.110
- It's an old mistake.
- I had a few myself.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.820
More than a few.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.030
I could leave tonight.

01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:35.840
Take my plane and go
anywhere we wanted.

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:41.360
Some day perhaps. Not tonight.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.340
Don't be shy!

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.540
Wayne said that you can
get me the 'Clean Slate'.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.830
- That depends ...
- On what?

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:20.520
On what you want it for..

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.710
I have acquire it to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.310
Still don't trust me huh...

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:31.410
- How can we change that?
- Start by taking me to Bane.

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.130
You asked...

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.470
From here, Bane's man
patrol the tunnels

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.760
and they're not your
average brawlers.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.040
Neither am I.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.650
- He's behind you!
- Who?

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.210
Me!

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:01.530
Where do you think you're going? ...

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.060
Less a little bully.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.280
I had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me.

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:29.080
You made a serious mistake.

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.290
Not as serious as yours ...

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.520
... I fear.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.560
- Bane ...
- Let's not stand on so moody here.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:46.230
Mr. Wayne ...

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:58.820
Peace has cost you your strength.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.390
Victory has defeated you.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:05.620
The adaptability and deception ...

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:08.460
powerful agents ...
to the uninitiated people.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.190
But we are initiated, aren't we Bruce?

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:15.230
Members of the League of Shadows.

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:19.790
And you betrayed us.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:26.500
Yes. You were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.520
I am the League of Shadows.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.550
I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny!

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.630
You fight like a younger man,
there's nothing held back.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.040
It's admirable, but mistaken.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.250
You think darkness is your ally?

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:12.150
You've merely adopted the
dark, I was born in it.

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:15.470
Molded by it ...

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:19.030
I didn't see the light until
I was already a man.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:22.180
By then was nothing to be blinded.

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:29.220
Shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.590
I'll show you where I had made my home.

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:41.280
Whilst preparing to bring justice.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.910
Then I will break you.

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:58.350
Your precious armory!
Great fully accepted.

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:00.750
We'll need it.

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.980
Ah yes! I was wondering
what would weight first...

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.250
Your spirit ...

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.410
... or your body?

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:10.460
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.560
I got a line up of Congressman's
kidnapping.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:26.610
- Excuse me, miss!
- Yes?

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.900
I'm going to need to see your
ticket and identification, please.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.690
Do you mind?

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:47.640
I showed your picture to The
Congressman. Guess what?!

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:52.020
- Don't tell me. Still in love?
- Oh head over heels.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.910
Pressing charges though.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.800
You've made some mistakes, Miss Kyle.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.780
- Girl's got to eat.
- And you have an appetite.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.180
Why would run? You can't hide
from us with a record like this.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:08.480
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
- Who then? Bane?

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.160
What do you know about him?

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.150
About you should be as
afraid of him as I am.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.330
You can offer you protection.

01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:20.920
Okay ...

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.390
When I spotted you, I was looking for
a friend of mine, Bruce Wayne.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.510
Did that killed him?

01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:37.200
I'm not sure.

01:17:56.530 --> 01:18:01.340
Why didn't you just kill me?

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:05.390
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.590
Your punishment must be mastered here.

01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:12.090
- You're the charger?
- Yes.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.950
But not of your body.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.720
Of your soul.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.890
- Where am I?
- Home.

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:30.760
Where I learned the truth
about despair, as will you.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.180
There's a reason why this
prison were a hell on earth.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.920
Hope.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.630
Every man who has lotted here over
the centuries looked up to the light

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:44.330
and imagine climbing to freedom.

01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:48.990
So easy, so simple!

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:55.220
Unless you break man turning into
seawater for uncontrollably fast.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.350
Many have died trying.

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:04.460
And then here can be no
true despair without hope.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.680
So as I terrorize Gotham,

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.460
I will feed it's deeper
hole to poison their souls.

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:14.950
I would let them live
so they can survived

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.200
and you can watch them
trampling over each other

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.480
... to stay in the sun.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.340
You could watch me
torturing an entire city.

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.580
And then when you truly understood
the depth of your failure,

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.310
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghu's destiny.

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:41.060
We will destroy Gotham.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:49.250
and then, what would you've
done, when Gotham is ashes ...

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.140
Then you have my permission to die.

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:13.190
You're locking her up in here?

01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:17.100
The Dent's act allowed non-segregation
based extraordinary needs.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.140
First time she broke out of women
correctional, she was 16.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.520
- A little closer, honey!
- Why honey? You want to hold my hand?

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.730
She's going to be fine.

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:31.030
I still don't see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project.

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:32.600
Bruce got a lot of things right,

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.190
keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.820
Oh good of you to join
us Chair President.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:46.470
All I need now is one more
Ordinary Board member.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:53.490
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
- No. I will volunteer.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.780
Where are you taking us?

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.110
You were right, Commissioner!

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.890
Would you excuses us, please?

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:09.930
What happened?

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.400
Your mask man kidnapped the
Wayne Enterprise’s Board.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.570
He let most of them go, but he took
three of them into the sewers.

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.770
No more patrols.
No more hide and seek.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:20.790
Get every available cop down
there and smoke him out.

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:25.040
- The Mayor won't want panic.
- So it's a training exercise?

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.270
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:34.260
Not you, you telling me
The Batman have gone.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:39.370
So you chase up the daggers
leads anyway you can.

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.810
Yes, sir.

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:55.990
He asks how you much would
pay us to let you die?

01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:58.820
I told him...I told him
you have nothing.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.440
You tell them pleasure!

01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:04.690
I paid more than that to
keep you alive.

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:13.690
You would try to climb.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.530
He can win? Everybody has?

01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:33.350
Well of course not!

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:45.900
He say there's one who did.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.730
A child.

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.880
A child born in this hell.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.750
- Bane ...
- An old legend. Nothing more.

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:06.810
What they really tease me, you
wanted to see is happening soon.

01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:34.190
Fire in the hole!

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.690
Turn it on!

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:12.270
I only need one other Board member,
there are eight others waiting.

01:24:12.650 --> 01:24:14.230
I won't do it.

01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:16.690
Alright stop!

01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:20.020
Lucius, you will kill
this man and yourself,

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.550
and you'll barely
slow them down.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.460
Go on then, do your work!

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.740
Take them up to the surface!

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:59.870
People of their status
deserve to experience

01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:03.460
the next era of
Western civilization.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.000
I had half of daggett some
of that plan some odd

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.220
location they pour for
underground construction.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.180
<i> anything strange about the pouring? </i>

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:18.680
Honestly, Commissioner. I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.140
But knowing about
patterns. Keep looking!

01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:31.990
It's done. This is now a
4 megatons nuclear bomb!

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:37.390
Pull the core out of the reactor!

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.960
No! You cannot!

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.100
This is the power source
capable of sustaining it.

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:48.380
If you move it, the core will
depleted in a matter of months.

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.570
- Five, by my calculations.
- It will go off!

01:25:54.070 --> 01:26:00.450
And for the sake of your children
Dr. Pavel, I did hope it does.

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:03.530
Hey, hey.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.530
That was you in front of
The Stock Exchange wasn't it?

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.810
When?

01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:13.690
When half the city cops try
to pull onto castle street

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:15.390
and your truck was
shutting them out.

01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:19.080
- Oh yeah ... you're the cop.
- Detective.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.370
And, as detective we're not allowed
to believe in coincidences.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:36.000
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:48.350
Commissioner it's Blake. I got two
dead witnesses and a lot of questions.

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:49.490
Call me when ...

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:54.060
Wait a minute!
Four barrels of polisobutilen.

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.420
That looks like motor
oil right next to it. Jesus!

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.450
They're not making cement,
they're making explosive!

01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:11.890
<i>- Patch me through Foley!
- Foley is overseeing the operation. </i>

01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:14.480
They're heading into a trap.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.730
We seeing literally thousand of
police heading into the sewer.

01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:18.980
Mr. Mayor, literally thousands of police ...

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.990
It's just a training exercise that's all.

01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:22.270
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.640
I got tickets to watch our
boys trash Rapid City.

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:27.710
Foley.

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:29.410
<i>It's a trap.
Pull all of them out! </i>

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.640
Bane has been pour concrete
rigs with explosives.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.160
Where?

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:50.090
<i>There's a ring
surrounding the tunnels!</i>

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.480
<i>They're going to blow it and
trap the cops underground!</i>

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.610
Pull them out! Now!

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.010
That's a lovely lovely voice!

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:06.110
Let the games begin!

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.090
Citizens take control ...

01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:50.780
Take control of your city!

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.480
- Foley!
- Jesus, Blake!

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.990
Every cop in the city is
down in those tunnels!

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.090
Not every cop.

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:19.510
Sir, you're okay? I'm a police
officer, I need your car right now.

01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:12.060
Play the corners, rookie!

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.850
Get the coat, son!

01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:21.350
This, this is the instrument
of your liberation.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.540
Satellite show some radiation spike.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.720
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:37.130
Identify yourself to the world!

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:42.590
Dr Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.650
Pavel was confirmed
dead, plane crash on an

01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:51.100
agency pull out of Uzbekistan
but it looks like it's him.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.950
And what, What is this?

01:32:54.950 --> 01:33:01.770
It's a fully prime neutron bomb
with a blast radius of 6 miles.

01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:06.200
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.170
Only me.

01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:14.120
Only you ... Thank you, good doctor!

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:20.490
Now, this bomb is armed.

01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:27.490
This bomb is mobile and the identity
of the trigger man is a mystery.

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:33.220
For one of you holds the detonator.

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:37.790
Now we came here not as
conquerors, but liberators

01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:42.350
to return control of this
city to the people.

01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:48.990
At the first sight of interference
of the outside world,

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:53.540
or to those people attempting to flee,

01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:58.090
This anonymous Gotham-might,

01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:02.940
this unsung hero will
trigger the bomb.

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:07.800
As of now, Martial Law is in effect.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.010
Return to your homes,

01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:16.490
hold your families
close and wait.

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:21.620
Tomorrow you claim
what is rightfully yours.

01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:31.190
Hold back the fighters! Start
high level reconnaissance flights.

01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:34.120
Get the president on the line!

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:58.650
<i> Tanks and planes cannot stop
us from detonating our device.</i>

01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:01.070
<i> Send a negotiator
to discuss term</i>

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:04.030
<i>of access to supplies
and communication! </i>

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.970
How many of you there, son?

01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:15.070
You don't have
enough man to stop

01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:17.390
12 million people from
leaving this island.

01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:21.840
No, no we don't. But you do.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.550
Why the hell would I try help
you to keep your hostages?

01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:32.010
If one person crosses this bridge,
Gotham gets blown to hell.

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:40.080
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient</i>

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.890
<i> They have proven this before
and they will prove it again. </i>

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:50.320
<i> We do not negotiate with terrorists, </i>

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.260
<i> But we do recognize realities. </i>

01:35:53.260 --> 01:36:00.330
<i>As this situation develops, one thing
must be understood above all others.</i>

01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:04.350
<i> People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you. </i>

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:06.270
What does that mean?

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.140
It means we're on our own.

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.260
I have to get in front of a camera.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.300
Well sir, they will kill you the
second you show your face.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.200
Bane says he's giving Gotham
back to the people.

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.620
They need to know I could lead.

01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:20.290
Bane is not going
to let that happen.

01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.670
- Then he will show his true colors
- Then you'd be dead.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.740
Behind you, stand a
symbol of oppression.

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:52.510
Blackgate Prison, where
a thousand men has

01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:56.720
languished under the
name of this man:

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.050
Harvey Dent.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:07.070
Who has been held to you as
the shinning example of justice.

01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:09.750
We're just keep moving you until we
can get you in front of a camera.

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:13.650
You have been supplied
with a false idol,

01:37:13.650 --> 01:37:17.940
to stop you tearing
down this corrupt city!

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:22.390
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent!

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:27.130
From the prayers of
Gotham Police Commissioner.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.090
James Gordon.

01:37:30.090 --> 01:37:36.030
<i>The Batman didn't murdered Harvey
Dent, he saved my boy.</i>

01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:40.040
<i>Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes,</i>

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.220
<i>So that I could threw my shame,</i>

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:50.210
<i>build a lie around this
fallen idol.</i>

01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:57.310
<i>I praised the mad man who
tried to kill my own child,</i>

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.280
<i>But I can no longer live
with my lie.</i>

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.440
<i>It's time to trust The people
of Gotham with the truth</i>

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.890
<i>And it is time for me to resign.</i>

01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:14.020
<i>And do you accept this
man resignation?</i>

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:20.230
And do you accept the
resignations of all these liars,

01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:22.030
of all the corrupt?

01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:28.940
Those men locked up for 8
years at Blackgate with

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:32.380
denied parole under the
Dent's act based on a lie?

01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:34.950
Gotham needed a hero.

01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:39.120
It needs it now more than ever.
You betrayed everything you stood for.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.750
What's the point?

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.690
Far out there when the
structures failing,

01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:51.160
and on the road, weapons
city more than shackles

01:38:51.190 --> 01:38:54.020
and letting the bad guy getting hit.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:00.200
One day, you may face
such a moment of crisis

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.630
and in that moment I hope
you have a friend like I did!

01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:10.820
To plunge their hands into the filth
so that you can keep yours clean.

01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:15.190
Your hands looks pretty filthy
to me, Commissioner.

01:39:15.190 --> 01:39:20.060
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:23.190
The rich.

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:29.830
The oppressors who for generation has
get you down with myth of opportunity,

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:35.720
and we give it back to
you, the people.

01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:40.940
Gotham is yours.
None shall interfered.

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.450
Do as you pleased.

01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:49.740
and start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.240
Step forward those who would serve.

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.350
To an army, a world will be raised.

01:40:08.690 --> 01:40:13.490
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent years...

01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:23.610
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure.

01:40:27.970 --> 01:40:32.010
Courts will be convened.

01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:41.610
Spoils will be enjoyed.

01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:48.090
Blood will be shed.

01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:53.010
The Police will survive

01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:57.700
as they learn to serve
true justice ...

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.590
This great city ...

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:06.170
it will endure ...!

01:41:07.170 --> 01:41:11.230
Gotham will survive!

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.930
He says you must first
fix your back.

01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:37.240
How does he know?

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.630
He was the prison doctor.
A morphine addict.

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.670
When heard of this pleasure
of powerful evil,

01:41:44.670 --> 01:41:47.660
including your mask friend.

01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.090
How?

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.640
Many years ago,
it was a time of plague.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.310
Some of the other
prisoners attacked Bane.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:04.290
The Doctor humbling attempt
to rebuild the damage,

01:42:04.290 --> 01:42:07.470
left him in perpetual agony.

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.860
The Mask hold the pain at bay.

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:16.440
Bane was the child who struck out?
He was born here?

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.240
Legend is that it was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.600
They felt in love with the
warlord's daughter.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.650
They were married in secret,
but the warlord found out.

01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:33.250
The mercenary was
condemned to this pit.

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.170
But then he exiled him instead.

01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:39.630
The mess I understood that it was the
daughter who secure his release.

01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:45.520
But what he could not know,
was the true price of his freedom.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.270
She took his place in the pit.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:55.170
And she was with child,
the mercenary child.

01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:00.960
Innocence cannot flower underground,
it has to be stem out ...

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:08.720
One day, the doctor
forgot to lock the cell.

01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:19.230
But the child had a friend,
a protector.

01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:23.830
Who showed the others that this
innocence was their redemption.

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.440
It was to be priced.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.650
The mother was not so lucky.

01:43:30.130 --> 01:43:34.900
This is Bane's prison now.
It wouldn't want this story told.

01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:49.380
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.940
It has to be put back.

01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:00.280
Stay like this until you stand.

01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:11.780
Did you not think I would
return, Bruce?

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:20.520
I told you I was immortal.

01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:23.970
I watched you die!

01:44:23.970 --> 01:44:28.200
Oh they're many forms of immortality.

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:33.400
Once I had a wife. My great love.

01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:37.610
She was taken from me.

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:40.500
You were the mercenary.

01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:47.240
Bane is your child, your heir.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:47.300
I'm here to ensure
The League of Shadow
Bane is your child, your heir.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.030
I'm here to ensure
The League of Shadow

01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:53.930
fulfills it's duty to restore
balance to civilization.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.760
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.100
with all your strength,
all your resources,

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:04.760
all your moral authority.

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:08.800
and the only victory you
achieved was a lie.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.980
Now, you understand?
Gotham is beyond saving

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.920
and must be allowed to die.

01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.040
No!

01:46:08.190 --> 01:46:10.420
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.840
Now, it's everyone's home.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.030
There's storm coming remember?
That is what we wanted.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.110
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:52.860
- Any news from the Commissioner?
- The less you know father..

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.450
How are the boys doing?

01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:57.840
Well we had more power on,
so they get some TV.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:01.350
- It's good to see you father.
- Blake, you be careful out there.

01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:04.320
They hunting down cops like dogs.

01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:14.440
- Why build yourself?
- I'm not meant to die in here.

01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:19.250
Here or there, what's the difference?

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:23.090
I told you it can not be done.

01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:25.940
You told me a child did it.

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:32.110
But no ordinary child,
a child born in hell,

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:38.340
forged from suffering,

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:42.610
harden by pain.

01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:46.840
Not a man from privileged.

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:06.830
We got blues in the ground sir.

01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:09.690
Just waiting on intel.

01:49:14.370 --> 01:49:17.250
- Do you have ID?
- Of course not.

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:20.860
- How can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:23.170
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.140
- Captain, glad to have you here.
- It's our job sir.

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.170
Now how many are
all you are they?

01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:30.850
Well there's dozen, I
rather not say exactly.

01:49:30.850 --> 01:49:34.150
The man trapped underground,
numbered almost 3,000.

01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:36.210
- What kind of condition are they in?
- They been getting in food and water.

01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:38.060
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:41.290
Take out the mercenaries guarding the
outflows south of Ackerman Park,

01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:44.200
blow the rubble, we can make a
hole big enough for 10 at a time.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.090
I'm in contact with my
partner down there.

01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:47.580
They're just waiting
for the day.

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.280
Commander, they haven't seen
daylight for three months.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.840
Police officers who haven't seen
daylight in three months.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:52.740
What about the bomb?

01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.150
The satellite can't pick up
any radiation hot spots.

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.680
They keep it on a truck.
It must have lead lined roof.

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.650
- They're moving constantly.
- Good, so you know the truck?

01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:05.100
Well it's one of the three.
We've been tracking it.

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.930
Decoy.

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:09.910
You're not really think
he's coming back, do you?

01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:11.050
Doesn't matter what I think.

01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:15.270
Actually it does. You should put
your faith in something more real.

01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:17.510
But the routes don't vary much.

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:20.950
- What about the trigger man?
- No leads. It's a bluff.

01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:23.510
Bane wouldn't gave control
on that to someone else.

01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:24.840
We can't take that chance.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.440
Until we have the trigger
man, we just track the device.

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:30.230
And mean while, Gotham
lives under a warlord?

01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:31.610
Like some failed state?

01:50:31.610 --> 01:50:34.630
Dialed it back, officer.
The situation is unprecedented.

01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:36.690
We can't do anything
to risk million of lives.

01:50:36.690 --> 01:50:40.070
Can't you tell? Aren't you going to
tell them what actually is going on?

01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:43.600
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.680
There's someone you need to meet.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:48.110
Came up stairs looking
for a vantage point.

01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:50.510
Found the people who runs the
corporation living up here.

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.250
What corporation?

01:50:51.250 --> 01:50:53.180
Wayne Enterprises.

01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:05.060
Mr. Fox would you like
to brief the captain?

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.850
Mrs. Tate is fully aware
of the situation.

01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:12.390
As the CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:14.620
- Why?
- We built it.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.130
You built the bomb?

01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:20.510
It was build as a fussion reactor.
First of it's kind

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:24.190
Bane turned the core into a bomb,
and remove it from the reactor.

01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:25.400
That's the important part.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.800
As the device's fuel
cells deteriorates,

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:31.590
it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation.

01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:35.790
- This bomb is a time bomb.
- And it will go off in 23 days.

01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:38.480
Regardless of the Bane's
revolution or what we

01:51:38.490 --> 01:51:40.600
and the outside
world choose to do.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.560
Your peace-man plan may not be
as practical as you thought.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.690
Could you disarm it?

01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:47.940
I could reconnect to the
reactor to stabilize it.

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.220
Let's move away from this
location and call it in.

01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.020
Alright let's go!

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:54.640
Let me take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:03.460
Someone sold us out.

01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:30.030
I'd die before I talk.

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:33.930
How about new schedule, Captain.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.190
- There were people living upstairs.
- Round them up for judgment.

01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:52.940
And hang them where the world to see.

01:53:07.630 --> 01:53:12.130
He says that the leap of
freedom is not about strength.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:16.360
- My body makes the jump.
- Surviving is spirit.

01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:24.400
My soul, is it ready to
escape with my body?

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:27.370
Feel is why you afraid?

01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:29.890
No, I'm not afraid.

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:33.040
I'm angry.

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.470
Bruce ...

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.490
Why did we fall?

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:18.500
You do not fear death. You think this
makes you strong? It makes you weak.

01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.850
Why?

01:54:20.850 --> 01:54:23.370
How can you move faster than possible?

01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:25.880
Fight longer than possible?

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.250
Without the most powerful
impulse left in you.

01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:33.100
The fear of death.

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:36.210
I fear death.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:41.290
I fear dying in here,
all my city burns,

01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:44.960
there's no one there to save it.

01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:48.430
And then make the climb!

01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:54.340
How?

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:58.150
As the child did.

01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:05.560
Without the rope.

01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:09.460
That fear will fight you again.

01:55:15.490 --> 01:55:19.910
Ah, surprise for your journey,
that's wonderful.

01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:28.430
- What does that mean?
- Rise.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.030
No.

01:57:00.690 --> 01:57:04.740
There's been a mistake.
Take me to Bane!

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:09.020
Where's Bane?

01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:16.080
Where's Bane?

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.890
There's no mistake Mr. Stryver.
You are Philip Stryver.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.790
Executive Vice President of
Daggett Industries?

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:27.770
Who for years has been
living off the blood

01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:30.800
and sweat of people
less powerful than him!

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.380
Call Bane!
I am one of you.

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:38.430
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:43.120
Now chooses are yours: exile or death?

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.650
- Exile.
- Sold!

01:57:52.650 --> 01:57:55.400
The man of the cold sweat.

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:06.230
You follow the thick ice. If you
try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

01:58:06.230 --> 01:58:08.030
So no one made it?

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:22.380
Where the hell are they?

01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:24.080
It's not like we have
a lot of time here.

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:27.110
- How long?
- The bomb goes off tomorrow.

01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:29.430
We have about 18 hours
to do something.

01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:30.120
To do what?

01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:32.690
To mark the truck.
Get a GPS on it,

01:58:32.690 --> 01:58:32.800
so we can start to figure
out how to bring it down.
To mark the truck.
Get a GPS on it,

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.390
so we can start to figure
out how to bring it down.

01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:43.200
That's it?

01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:47.410
Foley!

01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:50.600
Where is Foley? Damn it!

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.160
You shouldn't be out in the streets.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.700
Jim, he's not here.

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:02.720
You let your wife come to the door,
when the city is under occupation?

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:06.110
What did you do? Bury your
uniform in the backyard?

01:59:06.110 --> 01:59:08.250
You saw what they
did to the special forces.

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:10.500
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrolled?

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:13.290
When every gang banger want to plant
one as soon as our back are turned?

01:59:13.290 --> 01:59:15.800
Now is different and you know it.
This guys run the city.

01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:17.670
The government is done
a deal with them.

01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:20.610
Bane's got their balls on
the ice that's not a deal.

01:59:20.610 --> 01:59:23.810
If you move on Bane, the trigger-man
is going to hit the button.

01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:28.180
Do you think he's given control
of that bomb to one of the people?

01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:30.780
You think this apart
of some revolutions?

01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.380
There's only one man with his
finger on the button, that's Bane.

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.550
Look we all got to keep our heads
down until they can fix this.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.680
If you had family here ...

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.020
It's only get fix
from inside the city.

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:48.370
Look Peter, I'm not asking you to
walk down grand in you dress rules,

01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:49.470
but something has to be done.

01:59:49.570 --> 01:59:51.650
- I'm sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down..

01:59:51.650 --> 01:59:54.490
What's good that going to do
tomorrow when that thing blows.

01:59:54.490 --> 01:59:57.370
You don't know that's
going to happens.

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:03.440
I hear you're looking
for men Commissioner?

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.710
How about me instead?

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:09.880
- Miss Tate, I can't ask do do that.
- Please.

02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:14.540
- What you did?
- Nothing.

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.890
I didn't take anything.

02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:18.650
You steal from us? You little bastard.

02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:21.980
Now you boys know you
can't come in my

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.980
neighborhood without
asking politely.

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:33.670
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid!

02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.690
You're pretty generous for a thief!

02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:52.960
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:57.380
- If you expecting an apology ...
- It wouldn't suit you.

02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:58.970
I need your help.

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:03.050
- And why would I help you?
- For this. ' Clean Slate '.

02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:07.490
You trust me with that,
after what I did to you?

02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:10.570
I admit I was a little let down.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.790
But I still think
there more to you.

02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:16.870
In fact that, I think that.
For you, this isn't just a tool.

02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:21.090
It's an escape route you want
to disappear, start fresh.

02:01:21.090 --> 02:01:22.910
I couldn't even get
off this island.

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:25.920
I could give you a way off once
you to get me to Lucius Fox.

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.880
I need you to find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.880
- Why do you need Fox?
- To save the city.

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.250
Who says it needs saving?
Maybe I like it this way.

02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:40.930
Maybe you do.

02:01:40.930 --> 02:01:44.330
But tomorrow that bomb is going off.

02:01:45.930 --> 02:01:49.130
Get your powerful
friend on the case?

02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:51.490
I'm trying, but I need Fox.

02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:55.690
Once it approaches, flick the switch.

02:01:55.690 --> 02:01:58.260
The needle hit 200, you
give me the signal.

02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.950
I'll will mark truck. Okay?

02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:02.320
Heads up! Heads up!

02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:20.590
- I got it!
- Mercenaries at your 6.

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:24.430
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:28.810
Commissioner Gordon,
you're under arrest.

02:02:28.810 --> 02:02:30.120
On who's authority?

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.310
People of Gotham.

02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:37.410
No lawyer. No witnesses.
What sort of due process is this?

02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:41.110
You guilt have been determined.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

02:02:41.110 --> 02:02:43.550
Now what will it be?

02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:46.510
Death or exile?

02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:51.680
Crane, if you think we're going
out on that ice willingly,

02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:54.360
you have another thing coming.

02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:58.510
- Death then.
- Looks that way.

02:02:58.510 --> 02:03:01.940
Very well. Death!

02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:05.010
By exile.

02:03:06.730 --> 02:03:09.190
Bring her to me!

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:17.310
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:19.340
Let's gear on.

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.500
Spot this one on the spot.
Got a big day tomorrow.

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:31.400
We all do. Not every day
you bag Bruce Wayne!

02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:35.600
- Bruce?
- You okay?

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:38.010
You pick the hell of time to
go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:39.800
How long until that core ignites?

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.680
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.350
Unless we can reconnect
it to the reactor.

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:48.120
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.950
- Do what necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:53.220
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

02:03:53.230 --> 02:03:58.280
Sorry to spoil things boys but
they want these guys to themselves.

02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:02.900
- I won't forget about us, Miranda!
- I know.

02:04:11.850 --> 02:04:15.460
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne!
- He should be so lucky.

02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:26.600
Any move I make on Bane or the
bomb, the trigger-man will set it off.

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.650
They won’t use radio or
cell, too much interference.

02:04:29.650 --> 02:04:31.460
Infrared doesn't have the range.

02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.340
It had to be a Micro-burst,
long-range.

02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.170
- Can you block it?
- Yes.

02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:40.340
But I need the EMP cannon
guidance mounted on the Bat.

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.870
Remember where you parked it?

02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.300
- It fly okay?
- Yeah.

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:03.240
Even without the autopilot.
Thanks.

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:05.960
Autopilot?
That's what you're there for.

02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:47.790
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! Climb.

02:05:57.930 --> 02:05:59.450
Lock it up!

02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:05.650
Who are you?

02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:36.480
Light it up!

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:55.930
Mom check it out.

02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:58.070
Honey, take a look!

02:07:07.190 --> 02:07:09.450
Impossible!

02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:14.480
Keep her close!
He'll come for her.

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.550
- Where's Miranda Tate?
- Bane took her.

02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:22.020
He holds up city hall,
surrounded by his army.

02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:24.490
This blocks detonator
signal to the bomb.

02:07:24.490 --> 02:07:26.960
Get it on to it before sunrise.

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.340
If I hit the button when starts.

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:32.200
- When what start?
- War.

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:09.440
You missed a spot.

02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:15.740
If you're working alone,
wear a mask!

02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:18.050
I'm not afraid if they see me
standing up to these guys.

02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.860
The mask is not for you, it's to
protect the people you care about.

02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.540
Count to five and throw.

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.380
Hey no offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

02:08:48.170 --> 02:08:51.080
- What now?
- All out assault on Bane.

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.900
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:54.600
Why?

02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:59.240
In case we fail. Leave an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:03.780
- You don't need me here?
- You given me an army. Now, go!

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.920
- Alright, thanks!
- Don't thank me yet.

02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:10.210
Well, I might not get the chance later.

02:09:23.090 --> 02:09:24.540
You shouldn't have.

02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:28.170
All in town tunnel blocked by debris.

02:09:28.170 --> 02:09:31.490
But the cannon have anough fire
power to make a path for people.

02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:33.270
Wait until the fighting begins!

02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:36.550
You going to wage your war
to save your stuck up girlfriend?

02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:38.900
To start it, throttle.

02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:40.130
I got it.

02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:42.550
We have 45 minutes to save the city.

02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:46.130
No. I got 45 minutes to get
clear of the blast radius.

02:09:46.170 --> 02:09:47.530
because you don't stand
a chance against these guys.

02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:48.990
With your help, I might.

02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:51.890
I open that tunnel,
but then I'm gone.

02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:55.430
There's more to you than that.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.850
Sorry to keep letting you down.

02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:08.510
Come with me! Save yourself!

02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:15.110
You don't owe these people anymore.
You given them everything.

02:10:15.110 --> 02:10:18.950
Not everything. Not yet.

02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:02.820
Disperse! Disperse or be fired upon!

02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:06.580
There's only one police in this town,

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.830
Open fire!

02:12:37.690 --> 02:12:39.760
- Here it comes.
- Get ready!

02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:13.620
So you came back to die
with your city!

02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:17.630
No. I came back to stop you.

02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:29.720
Now!

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:43.710
That's impossible.

02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.500
Come over the fifth!

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:06.050
Get on the bus, go ahead.
You come with me! You too!

02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:09.420
Hey you, you and you, come here!

02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:11.360
Everyone else get on the bus! Okay.

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.370
You guys, you're going to knock
on doors and spread the word okay.

02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:17.500
The bomb going to go off.
Get out by South Street tunnel.

02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.630
or over the bridge.

02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:22.870
You go, you do two blocks, you get
back to the bus. Alright? Go! Go! Go.

02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:27.820
- Is he back?
- Keep your eyes open. Go!

02:15:49.670 --> 02:15:51.850
Cover the doors!

02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:57.700
Where's your trigger? Where is it?

02:15:58.810 --> 02:16:02.190
You never gave it to
any ordinary citizen.

02:16:02.190 --> 02:16:04.790
Where is it?
Where's the trigger?

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:08.860
Where is it?

02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:19.590
Tell me where the trigger is.

02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:22.440
Then, you have my permission to die.

02:16:35.390 --> 02:16:40.430
I broke you.
How did you come back?

02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:44.740
You think you're the only one who
could learn the strength to escape?

02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:49.360
- Where's the trigger?
- But I never escaped.

02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:52.500
But the child,

02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:55.980
Child of Ra's Al Ghul's,
who made the climb.

02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:59.210
But he's not the child
of Ra's Al Ghul.

02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:03.740
I am.

02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:09.480
Although I'm not ordinary,
I'm a citizen.

02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:29.970
Miranda?

02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.700
Why?

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.610
Thalia. My mother named me
Thalia before she was killed.

02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:45.490
The way I have been killed
if not for my protector, Bane.

02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:54.200
Good bye.

02:17:56.290 --> 02:17:59.250
I climbed out of the pit.

02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:06.740
I found my father

02:18:08.850 --> 02:18:12.710
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

02:18:12.710 --> 02:18:14.730
But by that time,

02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:19.770
the prisoners and the doctor
had their work to my friend,

02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:21.050
my protector.

02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:31.630
The League took us in and trained us
but my father could not accept Bane.

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.650
He saw only a monster,
whose very existence

02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:39.780
was the reminder of the hell
he left his wife to die in.

02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:43.130
He excommunicated Bane from
The League of Shadows.

02:18:43.130 --> 02:18:48.380
His only crime was
that he loved me.

02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:53.240
I could not forgive my father.

02:18:56.850 --> 02:18:59.380
Until you murdered him.

02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:21.630
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.740
Innocence is a strong word
to throw around Gotham roose.

02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:31.820
I honor my father by
finishing his work.

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.720
Vengeance against
the man who killed

02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:48.690
him is simply a reward
for my patience.

02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:50.970
You see?

02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:56.930
It's the slow knife.
The knife that takes it's time.

02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:05.490
The knife that wait years,
without forgetting,

02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:09.940
then slip quietly
between the bones,

02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:14.400
that's the knife that cut deepest.

02:20:14.470 --> 02:20:16.210
Please!

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.880
Maybe that knife was too slow.

02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:28.960
The truck is under attacked.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:32.360
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.630
No matter.

02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:39.420
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:45.080
Come on!

02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:54.010
Stay back! What are you doing?

02:20:54.010 --> 02:20:57.540
Blake. MCU, I'm getting
these boys to safety

02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.480
You're going to get
us all killed.

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.580
If anyone cross this bridge,
they'll blow up the city.

02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:05.740
It going to blow up anyway.
We need to open this bridge, now!

02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:09.480
Detective, if you take one step
forward we will shoot you!

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:13.210
If you do two forward,
we will blow the bridge.

02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:18.670
Go back to the bus and wait
for me alright! Just go back and wait.

02:21:21.730 --> 02:21:23.250
They've prepared a convoy.

02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:25.920
We must secure the bomb
until it detonates!

02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:31.360
Don't kill him. I want him
to feel the heat.

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:32.230
Heat the fire of 12 million souls.
Don't kill him. I want him
to feel the heat.

02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:34.190
Heat the fire of 12 million souls.

02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:35.540
You failed!

02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:43.720
Good bye, my friend!

02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:56.310
Keep moving forward!
Take back the stairs!

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:05.980
Shoot them!

02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:08.770
Shoot them all!

02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:21.610
We both know that I
have to kill you now.

02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:27.000
You have just to imagine the fire.

02:22:34.390 --> 02:22:36.760
About the whole no guns thing,

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.800
I'm not sure I feel strongly
about it as you do.

02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:54.870
Pull up!

02:22:58.130 --> 02:22:59.790
Stay level.

02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.640
We have to force them to
the entrance of the reactor.

02:23:16.970 --> 02:23:20.250
I need you on the ground.
I'll be leaving. Go!

02:23:20.250 --> 02:23:24.210
The situation has changed!
Your orders are out of date.

02:23:24.210 --> 02:23:28.320
I'm a cop like you and
I'm walking out there.

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:31.690
Please do not shoot me!

02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:34.320
Shoot at his knee.

02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:46.270
Nothing like a little air superiority.

02:23:46.270 --> 02:23:51.720
Detective, please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:57.570
Stop walking! Blow it! Do it!

02:24:09.090 --> 02:24:12.600
They have to get that bomb here
and you got ten minutes.

02:24:22.250 --> 02:24:25.080
They're pushing us to the
entrance of the reactor!

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.520
They're going to try
to reconnect the core.

02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:29.550
Idiots!

02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:36.090
You son-of-bitches! You killed them.
You're just following orders!

02:24:36.490 --> 02:24:38.670
Alright boys get in circle,
bow your heads.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.550
Not much longer.

02:25:31.290 --> 02:25:33.700
Let's get everyone back in the bus.
Okay?

02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:35.240
Go! Go! Back in the bus.

02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:38.180
There's no where to go!

02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:40.010
On the bus!

02:26:35.970 --> 02:26:39.380
You got to the truck EAST!

02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:44.590
Stay straight!

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:20.000
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:30.860
Fox showed me how overwrite reactor.

02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:34.940
Oh dear.

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.770
Including the emergency flood.

02:27:58.210 --> 02:28:05.210
There's no way this
bomb will be stopped.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.030
What are you doing?

02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:08.170
Protect them from the blast!

02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:09.570
We're going to be alright!
Double time! Go!

02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:10.870
It's an atom bomb!

02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:12.440
You think they need to
hear that right now?

02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.890
You want to watch them
die without hope? Come on!

02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:17.590
Prepare yourself.

02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:23.690
My father's work is done.

02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:32.010
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay.

02:28:32.010 --> 02:28:36.030
- Set it to fly over water and eject?
- No autopilot.

02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:41.430
You could've gone anywhere, did
anything but you came back here.

02:28:41.430 --> 02:28:45.690
- So did you.
- I guess we're both suckers.

02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:55.720
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:58.370
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

02:28:58.370 --> 02:28:59.680
Hero can be anyone.

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:02.430
Even a man knowing
something as simple as

02:29:02.430 --> 02:29:05.310
reassuring putting a
coat around a young boy

02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:08.570
shoulders to let him
the world hadn't end then.

02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:28.020
Bruce Wayne?

02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:44.400
Vlad, they go! You too!
Come on father.

02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:05.630
Hey heads down! This is it!

02:30:07.450 --> 02:30:09.260
No! That's Batman!

02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:58.520
That's detonation!

02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:08.550
It's out over the bay,
it's clear of the city.

02:31:27.310 --> 02:31:29.940
<i>I see a beautiful city</i>

02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:35.340
<i>and the the brilliant people
rising from this abyss.</i>

02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:40.050
<i>I see the lives, for which
I lay down my life.</i>

02:31:40.050 --> 02:31:46.150
<i>Peaceful, useful, prosperous
and happy.</i>

02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:52.260
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts</i>

02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:56.290
<i>And in the hearts of
their decedents.</i>

02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:59.620
<i>Generations ends.</i>

02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:05.960
<i>That's the far, far better
thing that I do...</i>

02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:09.340
... than I had ever done.

02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:14.110
and It's a far, far better
rest that I go to...

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:19.950
... than I had ever known.

02:32:37.530 --> 02:32:41.700
I'm so sorry. I failed you!

02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:45.070
You trusted me ...

02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:48.340
And I failed you.

02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:53.890
Can't I change your mind,

02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:58.130
about quitting the force?

02:32:58.130 --> 02:33:02.370
You know you said about
structures becoming shackles.

02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:06.250
You were right and I
can't take it, it's injustice.

02:33:07.890 --> 02:33:10.800
No one ever going to know
who saved the entire city.

02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:13.030
They know.

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.630
It was The Batman.

02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:37.730
Mr. Wayne's will is not amended to
reflect his more modest estate.

02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:40.730
Nonetheless, they're considerable
assets to dispose of.

02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:44.760
The content of the house are to
be sold to settle the state accounts.

02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:49.790
and the remainders left in it's
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:55.030
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition

02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:59.080
that they never be demolish, altered
or otherwise interfered with.

02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:04.080
That they shall be used for one
purpose and one purpose only:

02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:09.820
The housing and care of the city's
at risk and orphan children.

02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:11.840
And I clerk and help anyone with

02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:14.500
a small correspondences
and instruction.

02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:17.300
- Blake, John?
- Nothing here.

02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:18.440
Alright,

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:20.290
Try my legal name.

02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:26.820
You should use your full name.
I like that name, Robin.

02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:28.040
Thanks!

02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:29.790
Why are we even worrying
about stabilization software?

02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:32.550
This entire autopilot system
is completely obsolete.

02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:36.500
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:40.680
But Mr. Fox it's already been fixed,
software patch, six months ago.

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:43.330
Check the ID on the patch.

02:34:45.350 --> 02:34:47.440
Bruce Wayne.

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:50.370
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

02:34:50.370 --> 02:34:52.030
Better leave no stone unturned.

02:34:52.130 --> 02:34:55.270
We can't leave a string of
pearl on the manifest flaws.
