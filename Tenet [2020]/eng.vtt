WEBVTT

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:31.674
Hey!

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.940
We live in a twilight world.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.652
We live in a twilight world.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.650
And there are no friends at dusk.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.741
You've been made. This siege
is a blind for them to vanish you.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.668
But I established contact.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.045
Bring you in or kill you.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.627
You have two minutes.
Make up your mind.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.754
Where's the package?

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.092
Coat check.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.666
Stay.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.713
No friends at dusk, huh?

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:39.567
You'll do.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.148
Get him to the rally point.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.013
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.973
I've never seen encapsulation like this.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.233
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:21.403
Did you have an out?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.856
Service tunnel to the sewer.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.611
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:27.615
Can you defuse that?

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.506
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.409
Covering their tracks.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.225
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.559
That's not our mission.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.663
Mine now.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.151
Walk away.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.106
You don't have to kill these people.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:20.963
That wasn't one of us.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.496
I'll take the help.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.634
Go, go, go.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.658
A man can be trained
to hold out for about 18 hours,

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.794
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.835
He didn't last 18 minutes.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.758
He didn't have anything to hide.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.219
You were smuggling a nobody.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.932
It's risky.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.517
Or were you counting on this?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:26.901
Death.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.983
CIA issue.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.372
Spare yourself, once they clear.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.505
Almost 7:00.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.140
Uh-oh.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.930
It's running fast.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.194
We have to put it back one hour.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.169
Get it out!

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.242
Welcome to the afterlife.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.198
You've been in a medically-induced coma

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.911
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.124
The suicide pills are fake.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.292
Why?

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.582
A test.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.253
A test?

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.463
They pulled my teeth out.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.225
Did my team get clear?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.261
No.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.558
Private Russians, we think.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.478
Somebody talked.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.643
Not you.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.192
You chose to die
instead of giving up your colleagues.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.083
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:52.293
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.673
You do.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.506
I resign.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:04.050
You don't work for us. You're dead.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.100
Your duty transcends national interests.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.014
This is about survival.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.518
Whose?

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.447
Everyone's.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.152
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:26.906
To even know its true nature is to lose.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.541
This is knowledge divided.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.329
All I have for you is a gesture

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.668
in combination with a word.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.958
"Tenet."

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.089
Use it carefully.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.886
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.971
That's all they've told you?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.686
That test you passed?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.598
Not everybody does.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:09.153
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.945
Almost.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.080
An obscure tenet.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.840
No small talk.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.127
Nothing that might reveal who we are
or what we do.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.841
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.090
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:34.386
"What" is your department
and not my business.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.179
Well, to do what I do...

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.227
I need some idea of the threat we face.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.522
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent world war lll.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.361
Nuclear holocaust?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.945
No.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.032
Something worse.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.622
Aim it and pull the trigger.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.719
It's empty.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:06.887
Aim it.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.929
Check the magazine.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.522
How?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.861
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.738
The other one's going backwards.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.412
Can you tell which is which?

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.782
How about now?

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:41.001
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.164
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.459
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.637
You didn't make it?

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:49.969
No, we don't know how yet.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.470
So, where'd it come from?

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.757
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.846
They're streaming back at us.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.180
Try it.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.185
You have to have dropped it.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.162
How can it move before I touch it?

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.748
From your point of view, you caught it.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.083
But from the bullet's point of view,
you dropped it.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.998
But cause comes before effect.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.542
No, that's just the way we see time.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.878
Well, what about free will?

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.656
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:37.592
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.602
Don't try to understand it.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.105
Feel it.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.734
Instinct.

00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:57.612
Got it.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.453
Why does it feel so strange?

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.792
You're not shooting the bullet,

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.332
you're catching it.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.548
Whoa.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.089
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.268
In the field?

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.512
I was almost hit.

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.348
Then you were exceedingly lucky.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.932
An inverted bullet passing
through your body would be devastating.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.315
Not pretty.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.109
These look like today's.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.561
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.657
Where did you get them?

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.610
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.323
Do you have an analysis on the metals?

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.238
Sure. Why?

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.895
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.284
Look...

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.294
I'm not seeing armageddon here.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.500
The bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.511
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.432
If they can invert that,

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.803
I see no reason they couldn't invert
pretty much anything.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.014
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:06.727
An inverted weapon might be able
to affect our past as well.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.318
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:17.779
Remnants of complex objects.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:22.572
What do you think we're seeing?

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.035
The detritus of a coming war.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.210
- Yep?
- We live in a twilight world.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.475
No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.018
Even the dead need allies.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:53.356
Specifically?

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.906
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.076
Singh?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.960
He never leaves his house.
And his house is...

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.538
- His house.
- Yes, it is.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.116
I'm looking right at it.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.906
I'll see who's on deck.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.075
Bombay yacht club in two hours.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.752
It seems you need an introduction

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:23.971
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:26.229
I'm Neil.

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:28.388
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:31.853
That's not possible.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.360
Ten minutes tops.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.646
Time isn't the problem.

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:39.774
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.996
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.327
If I had to.

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.101
I'm not looking to make much noise here.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.459
Yes?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.497
Vodka tonic. And a diet coke.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:56.965
What?

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.134
You never drink on the job.

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.757
You're well-informed.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.469
Well, pays to be in our profession.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.555
Well, I prefer soda water.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.423
No, you don't.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.390
How's your parachuting?

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.400
I broke an ankle during basic training.

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.358
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:19.863
It's bungee-jumpable.

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:22.525
I don't think "bungee-jumpable”
is a word.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.490
It may not be a word, but it may be
our only way out of that place.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.705
Or into it, for that matter.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.914
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.937
Stay back.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.440
I was almost taken out by a very unusual
type of ammunition in Ukraine.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.478
I want to know who supplied it.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.270
My name is Sanjay.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.564
And you are?

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.445
No chitchat?

00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:30.866
There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you, anyway.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.369
Don't let it get cold.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.373
Why should I know who supplied it?

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:41.459
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.778
If it's from India, it's from you.

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.463
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.047
Deduction, then.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.803
Look, my friend...

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.840
Guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.509
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.255
Or the man they send to make deals.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.769
But I am the man people talk to.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.818
I can't.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.193
I can't tell you.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:05.425
You're an arms dealer, friend.

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.815
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.450
To say anything about a client

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.828
would violate the tenets he lives by.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.665
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:18.545
Everything.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.045
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:25.170
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

00:22:25.803 --> 00:22:26.803
Cheers.

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:29.094
Priya. Hmm.

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.172
This is your operation?

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.804
A masculine front in a man's world
has its uses.

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.890
The dealer you're looking for
is andrei sator.

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:38.429
The Russian oligarch.

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.222
- You know him?
- Not personally.

00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:42.733
Made his billions in gas.

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:46.191
Moved to London.
Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.026
Very good.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.782
Except the gas he made his billions from
was actually plutonium.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:55.162
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.664
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.291
So how did he get them inverted?

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:03.086
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

00:23:03.257 --> 00:23:05.248
Between our time and the future.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.375
He can communicate with the future?

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.044
We all do, don't we?

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.133
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:15.220
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:19.478
The question is,
can the future speak back?

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.680
And I'm supposed to find out?

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:25.939
To get anywhere near sator
would take a fresh-faced protagonist.

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:28.946
And you are fresh as a Daisy.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.408
Get close.

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.942
Find out what he's receiving and how.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.985
Is it safe to involve
British intelligence?

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:37.701
I have a contact
who's out of sator's reach.

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.795
You must've had a plan for getting out.

00:23:46.717 --> 00:23:48.503
Not one I love.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.065
May I help you, sir?

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:14.859
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.779
I presume you mean
sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.037
Presume away.

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.664
If you'll follow me.

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:27.588
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:29.590
I'll catch up.

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:31.674
Same for me, please.

00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:33.031
I'll send the waiter.

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.670
No, just pass on the order.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:38.348
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:41.135
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:44.138
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.648
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.726
But they don't seem to care.

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:49.984
Tell me about him.

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.647
I assume you're familiar
with the Soviet-era secret cities.

00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:58.239
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:01.497
Most of them have been opened up
and renamed as regular towns.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.328
Not the one sator grew up in.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.582
Stalsk-12.

00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:07.920
In the "70s, it had a population
of about 200,000.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.125
Thought to be abandoned.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.171
Abandoned?

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:14.711
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:17.470
Two weeks ago,
same day as the Kiev opera siege,

00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:20.678
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.889
just where stalsk-12 was.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.518
Sator emerged
from this blank spot on the map

00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:28.690
with ambition...

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:31.728
And enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:32.735
Through his wife?

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:35.943
Katherine barton.
Oldest niece of sir Frederick barton.

00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:38.279
She works at shipley's.
Met sator at an auction.

00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:39.454
A happy marriage?

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:40.952
Practically estranged.

00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:42.827
Well, how do I get to sator?

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:44.247
Well, through her, of course.

00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.909
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:48.588
Hardly.

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:51.664
We have an Ace in the hole.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.965
You're carrying a goya in a harrods bag.

00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.095
It's a fake by a spaniard named arepo.

00:26:00.017 --> 00:26:02.804
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

00:26:03.187 --> 00:26:04.427
What happened to the other one?

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:07.475
It turned up at shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine barton.

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:08.649
Put on auction.

00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:10.641
And who do you think bought it?

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:11.819
Her husband?

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:12.939
Mmm-hmm.

00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:16.154
Does she know it's a forgery?

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:17.531
Oh, it's hard to say.

00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:21.569
Rumor has it that
she and arepo were close.

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:22.862
Uh-huh.

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:26.081
Look, no offense,

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.664
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.372
Brooks brothers won't cut it.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.086
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.672
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:40.136
Can I recommend a tailor?

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.422
I'll manage.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.841
You British don't have a monopoly
on snobbery, you know.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.259
Well, not a monopoly.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.393
More of a controlling interest.

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:50.352
Could you box that up for me?

00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:51.526
Certainly not.

00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:54.734
Goodbye, sir Michael.

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.810
How can I help, sir?

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:35.146
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320
Goya.

00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:38.483
Mr. goya.

00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:41.281
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about goya.

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.281
That's extraordinary.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:51.867
What's it worth?

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.787
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:59.045
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:04.259
Provenance, microscopic examination,
x-rays.

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:06.515
But what does your heart tell you?

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.692
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:14.689
Tomas arepo.

00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.697
I bought my goya for cents on a dollar
from an irate Swiss banker.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:24.654
Traced it back to arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.535
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.867
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.269
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:32.874
My drawing's a very good fake.

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:34.455
You know that better than anyone.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.870
The information's the bargain.

00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.086
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.252
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.866
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.175
Arrangement?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.681
You mean blackmail.

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.136
Don't be afraid of the word.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:51.302
My husband isn't.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.141
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.195
He knows?
And he's never done anything about it?

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.439
Why would he?

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.100
He paid $9 million for it.

00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:00.559
Barely cover the cost of the holiday
he just forced us on.

00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:02.112
Where'd you go, Mars?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.112
Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht.

00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:09.820
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.349
Think you're a little out of your depth.

00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:16.665
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:20.422
generally aren't okay with being
cheated out of any of it.

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:28.263
The drawing is his hold over me.

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:37.431
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.476
He controls me.

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:44.397
My contact with my son. Everything.

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:47.782
Leaving would never have been easy,
but now it's impossible.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.070
You can't fight.

00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.739
Just beg.

00:29:56.003 --> 00:29:57.618
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.

00:29:58.255 --> 00:30:01.418
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:05.675
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:08.094
imitating some earlier time
in our lives.

00:30:08.265 --> 00:30:10.426
He seemed happy, so I asked him.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.266
And he made me an offer.

00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:16.019
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.984
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.

00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:25.146
He called us, contrite.

00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.022
And when we got back,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.928
I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,

00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:30.362
and he'd vanished.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:35.284
I never felt such envy.

00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:36.744
You don't seem the jealous type.

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:38.408
Of her freedom.

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.791
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.253
But you share a son.

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.835
That's my life now.

00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.509
Did you know the drawing was a fake?

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600
No.

00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:55.133
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.312
I failed.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.096
Andrei can't conceive of failure,
only betrayal.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.935
But I didn't betray my husband.

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:03.521
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.356
And he let arepo walk free.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.486
If you'd actually met arepo
as you claimed,

00:31:07.657 --> 00:31:10.148
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:11.442
We spoke on the phone.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.281
He can't do that either.

00:31:13.914 --> 00:31:15.700
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:17.364
Get me an introduction.

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.248
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:21.660
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.670
I might just be your second chance.

00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:26.581
No, I don't need redemption.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.091
At betrayal.

00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:35.224
Friends of your husband's?

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:37.846
You knew this was going to happen?

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:40.228
Don't worry, they won't kill you.

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:43.391
Andrei dislikes tangling with
local law enforcement on that level.

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:45.684
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:46.897
The look of you's fine.

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:50.360
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:52.762
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:54.071
Don't call from home.

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:57.404
You won't be taking my call.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:01.207
I might surprise you.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.108
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.529
Can we get going?

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:53.384
Please?

00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:55.337
He wants you to see.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.707
And he gets what he wants.

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.249
Not always, apparently.

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.078
Anna says we're going to Pompeii

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.015
and see lava.

00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:43.518
We will. We'll go together.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.303
I'll be there, too!

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.624
Told you I'd surprise you.

00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:09.338
He's a cute kid.

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:10.548
He's everything.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:14.624
Where's the drawing?

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:16.418
Oslo. At the airport.

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:17.805
The airport?

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.755
Do you know what a freeport is?

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:23.287
A storage facility for art
that was acquired...

00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:24.596
But not yet taxed.

00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:27.262
We started a network

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:31.187
rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.

00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:33.226
The facilities are tax havens.

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.967
The clients can view their
investments without importing them,

00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.982
so they avoid paying tax.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.776
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

00:34:40.954 --> 00:34:42.069
Art, antiquities.

00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.367
- Anything of value, really.
- Anything?

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.114
Anything legal.

00:34:46.293 --> 00:34:48.053
But it's not unlike the Swiss
banking system.

00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:49.542
Opaque.

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:54.797
As I'm sure you are aware,
most freeports are just warehouses.

00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:57.630
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.157
Rotas has assets in the Oslo freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:02.172
And this way to the vaults!

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.090
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.430
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.203
To view art?
And whatever it is he does.

00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:11.223
Turns out art's
of no importance to andrei.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.146
But the freeports are.

00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:16.937
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:19.822
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:22.655
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:38.338
Some of our clients opt
for biometric access, straight in...

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.302
Off the tarmac.

00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:42.553
From the terminal?

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.465
From their private planes.

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:46.679
Of course.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.428
Our logistics department
ships to and from

00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:51.751
any other freeport in the world

00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.311
without customs inspection.

00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:55.622
What are you hoping
to find in there?

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:56.859
You really wanna know?

00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:58.732
I'm not sure.

00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:00.818
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.201
Jesus.

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:03.946
It's nuclear.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.111
When you're on the tour,

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.245
pay attention to the fire precautions.

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.020
Documents are vulnerable to...

00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.375
Fire? Absolutely!

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.899
No, I was going to say water damage
from the sprinkler systems.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.959
We don't use sprinklers.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.749
The facility is flooded with halide gas,

00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:21.884
displacing all the air within seconds.

00:36:23.223 --> 00:36:24.223
Can you show me?

00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:26.473
If I did, we'd suffocate.

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:28.846
What about the staff?

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.556
Halide only fills the vaults,

00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:32.387
they just have to get
into either corridor,

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:34.435
and there is a ten-second warning.

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:36.145
At least you give them ten seconds.

00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:41.276
Well, sir, our clients use us
because we have no priorities

00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:42.734
above their property.

00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:43.948
Blimey.

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.525
All doors are fireproof.

00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:48.446
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:50.329
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.785
Why a lockdown?

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.702
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:57.461
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.710
And pickable locks.

00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:01.153
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:02.177
Child's play?

00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:03.630
They're inside airport security.

00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:06.717
They have to worry about
climate control, not armed raids.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.553
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:11.309
to trigger the lockdown procedure?

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.642
Back wall of the freeport.

00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:15.931
You've got something?

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.350
Not gonna like it.

00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.985
You wanna crash a plane?

00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.397
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:26.191
I want to run a jet off the taxiway

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.572
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:32.079
Well, how big a plane?

00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:36.668
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:39.580
This is mahir.

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:40.838
His team'll work the plane.

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.082
There can't be passengers.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.796
Norsk freight.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.211
They use the hangar
on the West Side of the freeport.

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.629
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:50.261
We pop the slides, Chuck 'em off.

00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:51.675
On the move?

00:37:51.853 --> 00:37:53.343
What's the problem? They'll be fine.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:56.100
Well, it seems bold.

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:59.016
Bold I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say nuts.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.254
And if you get caught?

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:01.278
We won't.

00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:02.606
And if you do?

00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:05.525
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:08.529
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:10.443
It'll barely make the news.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.870
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:15.248
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:16.533
Gold bars?

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.793
Norsk freight ships treasury gold
once a month.

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:21.329
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:25.876
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.160
The space in the center
of the Pentagon is too big.

00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:32.424
There's something there.

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.385
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:38.604
That's 45 seconds.

00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:39.855
Ample.

00:38:39.943 --> 00:38:41.149
Won't you be running?

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.298
All right, it's your turn.

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:45.687
Start packing.

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:04.860
Gentlemen, if you would,
through the detector, please.

00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:09.847
Sir?

00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.171
Oh.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.599
And, sir.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.645
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.420
No, I'll take an Espresso.

00:39:25.488 --> 00:39:27.149
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.859
Excellent.

00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:39.676
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

00:39:39.836 --> 00:39:41.827
Because all I got here is vegetarian.

00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:46.248
So that looks like meat,

00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:48.988
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:51.173
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:53.015
Okay.

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.516
This way, gentlemen.

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.701
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:32.589
Carry on. Not the radio.

00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:40.601
Let's go.

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.410
Uh...

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.010
Yoga.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.965
Let's go! Now!

00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:50.549
Go, go, go!

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.246
Right. Um...

00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.523
You said ten seconds, right?

00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:07.513
There's someone in here with us.

00:44:21.868 --> 00:44:23.904
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:53.231
Don't touch them!

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.435
The hell happened here?

00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:02.813
It hasn't happened yet.

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:23.249
Don't kill him!

00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:26.374
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:30.545
Why are you here?

00:47:30.723 --> 00:47:32.429
Who are you?

00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:35.224
How'd you know we'd be here?

00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:51.941
We need to go.

00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.115
What happened to the other guy?

00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:01.834
Took care of him.

00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:17.997
Well, I've seen too much.

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.641
I'm still alive, which must mean
you've decided to trust me.

00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:22.521
Or maybe I lost my edge.

00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:24.272
Edge is still intact.

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:27.977
There's a cold war.

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:29.489
Nuclear?

00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:31.064
Temporal.

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:33.451
Time travel?

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:34.536
No.

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.779
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.497
You mean reverse chronology.

00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:43.146
Like feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.250
moving backwards in time?

00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:46.083
Sure, that's exactly what I meant.

00:48:46.257 --> 00:48:47.667
I have a master's in physics.

00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:49.173
Well, try and keep up.

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.799
The implications of this are...

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:51.970
Beyond secret.

00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:53.176
Then why'd you bring me in?

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:56.138
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:57.923
Not as surprised as I was.

00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:00.969
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:05.144
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:08.730
It's all about plutonium.

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:10.382
And when we're done, they'll kill you.

00:49:10.406 --> 00:49:12.647
Won't you have to do that anyway?

00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:14.940
I'd rather it be my decision.

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:16.119
So would I.

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:17.829
I think.

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:30.967
Your work?

00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:38.259
Two antagonists. One inverted.

00:49:38.434 --> 00:49:42.143
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:43.644
Both emerged at the same moment?

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:44.814
Yeanh.

00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:46.639
They were the same person.

00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:50.066
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.

00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:51.443
Turnstile?

00:49:51.614 --> 00:49:54.026
A machine for inverting.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.816
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:57.994
It hasn't.

00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.357
He's been given it by the future.

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:00.907
For what?

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:03.118
You have the best chance of finding out.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.521
- Have you met him?
- / was close.

00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.877
What if you have something he needs?

00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.413
Such as?

00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:12.707
Plutonium-241.

00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:15.922
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241
from under a CIA team

00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:18.462
at the opera siege in Kiev.

00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:20.006
He got the team.

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.219
Not the 241.

00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:22.223
Who did?

00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.555
Ukrainian security services.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.016
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.933
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.101
is unacceptable, priya.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.065
I'm just gonna take him out.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.481
No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive.

00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:39.275
He has to stay alive
until we know his part in things.

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:40.863
Leverage the situation,

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:43.029
without losing control of the 241.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.663
It's too dangerous.

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:47.119
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:49.910
is nothing compared with
what will happen if we don't stop sator.

00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:51.670
From doing what?

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.458
We are being attacked by the future.

00:50:56.929 --> 00:50:59.762
And sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

00:51:15.781 --> 00:51:18.067
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.903
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.692
You destroyed it?

00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:24.074
I didn't think you'd want it back.

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:25.248
Does he know?

00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:26.784
Not yet. So sit tight.

00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:27.994
Sit tight?

00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:30.897
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.001
It won't be long.

00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:34.668
In the meantime, introduce me.

00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:36.301
As what?

00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:39.047
I'm a former first secretary
from the American embassy in Riyadh.

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:40.969
We met at a party last June.

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.867
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:45.223
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:48.056
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.936
Sator left early. That's when we met.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.517
I came into shipley's in London.

00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:53.182
You ran into me here

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.941
and wanna show me your yacht.

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.818
He'll think we're having an affair.

00:51:57.406 --> 00:51:58.406
Then he'll wanna meet me.

00:51:58.574 --> 00:51:59.574
Or have you killed.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.816
Let me worry about that.

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:03.609
Did I look worried?

00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:06.571
Sleeps 70 with crew.

00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:09.240
Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:10.749
Afraid of pirates?

00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:13.410
Andrel lives playing
one government off the other.

00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:15.069
The day they turn, that's his refuge.

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:16.382
May I join you?

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.132
Not sure volkov's taking passengers
just now.

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.964
Then we'll take mine.

00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:55.922
Max!

00:52:57.633 --> 00:52:59.624
Who's the American?

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.011
He's a friend.

00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:04.340
The man from shipley's.

00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.673
Who you tried to have beaten up.

00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:11.177
I ask again, who is he?

00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:16.390
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American embassy.

00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:18.980
Good with fists for a diplomat.

00:53:19.154 --> 00:53:21.145
Paranoia's your department, andrei.

00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:24.440
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:25.778
Max?

00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:28.820
He's visiting Pompeii and herculaneum.

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:30.279
You just sent him off?

00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:33.077
I promised him I'd go with him.

00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:35.535
I explained you were busy.

00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:39.417
With your friend.

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:02.027
Hey, easy, fella.

00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:04.821
Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.831
- Mr. sator.
- Don't bother.

00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:21.706
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

00:54:22.301 --> 00:54:23.962
Uh... no.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:25.970
Not yet.

00:54:27.347 --> 00:54:29.087
How would you like to die?

00:54:29.808 --> 00:54:30.808
Old.

00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:33.388
You chose the wrong profession.

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.103
There's a walled garden up the road.

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:39.515
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:42.605
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.646
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:47.280
block the windpipe.

00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:48.868
Complex.

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.819
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:55.831
try to pull his own balls
out of his throat before he chokes.

00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:57.521
Is this how you treat all your guests?

00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.084
We're finished.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.133
Do you like opera?

00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:12.096
Well?

00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:13.473
Not here.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.810
You sail?

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.187
I've messed around on boats.

00:55:19.358 --> 00:55:22.270
Be on the dock at 8:00
ready to do more than mess around.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.820
8:00 am.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.701
Max has missed
too much school this year.

00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.106
I'm taking him back to england.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:43.900
The school won't be okay
with him missing so much of the term.

00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:45.630
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

00:55:46.844 --> 00:55:48.755
You have all the trappings of a king.

00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.295
We both know you're a grubby little man
playing power games

00:55:51.473 --> 00:55:53.259
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:55.928
You seem...

00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:58.848
Spirited today.

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:02.890
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.523
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:14.660
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:18.368
I've always had instincts
about the future.

00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:23.164
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.014
Sailing or diving?

00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.570
Rising!

00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:25.438
What do you know about opera?

00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:28.896
In 2008,
a remote Russian missile station

00:57:29.071 --> 00:57:31.153
was overwhelmed and held for a week.

00:57:31.823 --> 00:57:33.563
When the station was retaken,

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:37.405
241 on one warhead
was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.491
The missing 241

00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:46.581
surfaced at the opera house siege
in Kiev on the 14th.

00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:48.495
Coming about!

00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.773
What do you propose?

00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:10.736
Partnership.

00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:12.777
I wouldn't partner with you.

00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:15.940
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.321
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

00:58:19.413 --> 00:58:20.994
who knows how to cover his tracks.

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:22.244
Not that shocking.

00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:24.657
For an intelligence agent.

00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:26.621
Right!

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.746
Burn in hell, andrei.

00:58:38.306 --> 00:58:40.012
You can't jibe a boat like this!

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.423
You can if you have to.

00:59:09.296 --> 00:59:11.036
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.294
I need him.

00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:13.959
What, to sell guns?

00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:15.214
I'm not who you think I am.

00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:16.382
Well, that I know.

00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.214
He showed me the drawing.

00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:21.676
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.730
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.301
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480
He's so much more.

00:59:28.065 --> 00:59:29.065
What, then?

00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:32.729
Andrei sator holds all of our lives
in his hands, not just yours.

00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:42.572
Mr. sator wants to see you.

00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:43.746
Okay.

00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:45.289
Now.

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.407
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?

00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:56.214
- Trust me.
- Save it.

00:59:56.384 --> 00:59:58.466
I'm not falling for it twice.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.053
You have a better option?

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.925
Whatever it takes to get what you want.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.595
Not a second's thought for me or my son.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.352
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.368
Try not to use it.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.039
On anyone.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.750
Enough.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.302
See? Pulse of a man half my age.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.178
Drink with me.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.019
It seems I now owe you my life.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.610
It's nothing.

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.359
My life is not nothing.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:01.146
And I don't like to be in debt.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.319
Then pay me.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.529
No retribution against your wife.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:11.156
You think she released my harness?

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.415
It was my own mistake.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.001
Then help me steal the 241.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.417
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.489
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.923
I know what it means.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.259
You lecture me about radiation?

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.182
Andrei sator,

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:37.895
digging plutonium from the rubble
of my city as a teenager.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.069
Where?

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.609
Stalsk-12.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.118
My home.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:53.453
One part of a warhead exploded
at ground level, scattering the others.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.631
It became my first contract.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:05.089
Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.141
But...

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:13.726
One man's probability of death...

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:19.813
1ls another man's possibility
for a life.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.730
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.701
Even now, my company
is the only one to operate in the ruins.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:33.697
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.959
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in trieste.

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:41.455
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.507
Stay with us tonight.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.297
I insist.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:18.832
What do you want?

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.040
We're going to talk about today.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.007
No, we're not.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.174
No?

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:27.212
We'll see.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.362
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.220
like you treat your other women.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.221
And, uh...

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.304
How do you imagine...

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.730
I treat these other women, huh?

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.357
You think I force them
into conversation?

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.893
You wanna be quiet, fine.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.686
You can bite down on that.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:53.239
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.825
Is fear and pain enough, andrei?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.240
That's all I have to offer you.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:03:59.866
Well, that will have to do, then.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.661
Why didn't you just let me go?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.830
Because...

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:11.462
If I can't have you...

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.549
No one else can.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.678
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.645
You think I let him interfere?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.307
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:25.521
End of deal.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:29.479
So you leave me alone.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.899
Not now!

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:56.968
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.685
He was at the window.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:12.692
I was curious.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.939
My property shouldn't concern you.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:18.697
Who are you?

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.950
How do you come by
your information about the opera?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.363
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.830
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.374
They're usually buying, not selling.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:34.873
But we do live in a twilight world.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.841
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.717
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.384
No balls in my throat?

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:46.055
There will be no time for such things...

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.229
In Tallinn.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:51.557
You make your way there.
I want volkov on your team.

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:52.769
No.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:59.522
I spring the material. You pay me off.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.282
Your wife does the exchange.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.846
I never involve her in my business.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.360
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:06.488
Put him ashore.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.310
How do I contact you?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.164
You don't.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.996
How do you advance me the funds?

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.874
Handle the plutonium better than that.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:29.206
What did you find on the gold?

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.221
No Franks, no mold marks.
Nothing.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.355
- How?
- Dead drops.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:36.859
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:40.063
then digs it up to collect
the inverted materials they sent.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.450
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.532
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.446
What did the soil samples show?

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.998
Northern Europe, Asia.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.329
Radioactive.

01:08:52.503 --> 01:08:55.370
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

01:08:56.257 --> 01:08:57.257
Why am I here?

01:08:57.383 --> 01:09:00.591
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:03.867
Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:06.799
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:09.058
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:10.843
They have a point.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.042
Is the convoy monitored from the air?

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.729
Tracked by GPS.
One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.184
We need big guns.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.565
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.857
We need a fast car that
doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:25.241
All different.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.278
Bus, coach, 18-Wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

01:09:29.123 --> 01:09:32.115
Most of all, we have to set this up
with nothing in the record.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.200
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:38.497
I don't want sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.291
His ignorance is our only protection.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.121
You see, Kat?

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:23.333
Some of my favorites.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:29.722
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.383
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:36.020
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:39.315
But this is where our worlds collide.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.066
What is this, andrei?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.229
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.399
The filthy business

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.408
that put those clothes on your back
and our boy in his school,

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.743
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.004
Time to go.

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:07.459
I'm not going anywhere with him.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680
Ll ook at me!

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.427
And understand,

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.139
you don't negotiate with a tiger.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:19.306
You admire a tiger until he turns on you

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:23.443
and you feel its true fucking nature!

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.437
Don't.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.527
You stay right there.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.487
Green. Two minutes.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.432
You are not going to kill me.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.313
I already tried.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.515
You pushed me off a boat.

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:04.566
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.270
My blood's not cold, andrei.

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:10.565
No, but you're not angry enough.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.737
Because anger scars over into despair.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.041
I look in your eyes...

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:23.161
I see despair.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.213
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:31.878
Thinking that you're better!

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:33.136
Enough!

01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:00.247
Tell me everything as it happens.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.459
Seal me this side.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.100
Yellow, 60 seconds.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:25.811
60. Check.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.995
Blue, 45 seconds.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:44.992
Blue, 45, check.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.928
Okay, red. Coming to you.

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:21.862
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.454
All right, everyone set?

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.292
And five...

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.589
Four...

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:20.557
Three...

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:22.642
Two...

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:25.812
One.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:49.537
Go, yellow!

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:54.622
We got a problem!

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.542
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.004
Check the radio chatter.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.302
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:26.736
This is not one of them.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:28.492
That's what he's after.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:33.409
Can't understand this.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.994
You said you spoke Estonian.

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:36.579
It's not Estonian.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:37.834
It's backwards.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.500
The hell is that?

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:01.149
Go, go, go!

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.194
Don't give it to him.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:50.858
This isn't plutonium.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.396
It's worse than that, god damn it!

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.091
Sorry.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240
He's getting away.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.512
He left her in the car!

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.822
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:49.508
Pull up alongside!

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.609
Come on, come on. Closer!

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.982
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.701
Hurry up!

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.367
Please!

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:58.243
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:00.491
What cavalry?

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.937
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.087
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.071
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:17.177
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.532
is it really in the BMW?

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:20.786
I don't know.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.285
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.166
I eave her alone!

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:26.699
Kill him!

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.708
I don't have time to negotiate.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.570
- Listen to me!
- Three.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:36.594
I can help you.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.884
- Help me!
- Two.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.055
Please!

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:40.216
- Don't!
- One.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.286
Next one's a bullet to the head.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.346
- No!
- One.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.061
Two. Three.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.395
Okay! Okay.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:55.398
The car. The BMW.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:56.402
I left it in the bmv.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.009
We're going to check
this is real.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:01.786
It's in the glove box!

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.915
Where did you leave it?

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.865
Car or fire truck, which one?

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.883
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.714
I believe you.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.374
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:29.932
Clear!

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.040
Wheeler, go check the other side.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.390
You two.

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:34.649
Where did he go?

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.736
The past.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.367
It's in the glove box!

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.802
We're going to check
this is real.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.471
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:10.206
Next one's a bullet to the head.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:13.848
- No! No!
- One.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.516
- Listen to me.
- Two.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:16.812
Three.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:18.667
I can help you.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:20.062
I don't have time to negotiate.

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.229
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:25.096
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.280
is it really in the BMW?

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:27.576
I don't know.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.749
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:31.827
Who told you that?

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:34.247
If you're not telling the truth,
she dies.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:36.501
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.000
- Medic!
- Check in.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.928
She's been shot?

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:54.854
Bring her back, this side.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.016
Was she shot with an inverted round?

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.489
This is ives. He's one of us.

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:08.944
"Us"! Who are these guys?

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.204
Priya's. Ours.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.865
How did sator know about the ambush?

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:14.374
It's posterity.

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:16.981
An ambush in the middle of the street
can't stay out of the records.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.963
Bullshit! He knew every move we made!
Every one of 'em.

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:21.339
Somebody talked. Who was it?

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:22.750
- Was it you?
- No. No.

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:25.586
At every stage, you've known too much.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:28.471
I'm going to ask you again.

01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:31.384
Did you talk?

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:34.599
Nobody talked.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.059
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:38.849
A what?

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.565
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.613
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:48.742
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.277
knowing everything.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.055
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:54.322
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:55.853
I told you
it was what he was after.

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.243
And you just told him where it was.

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.537
I lied.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:04.503
Jesus. You lied about it?

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:07.920
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:11.301
Lying is standard operating procedure.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.636
It's spread too far.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:13.811
Meaning what?

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.135
She's gonna die.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.849
Standard operating procedure.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:18.888
Can't you help her? Can we do something?

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.729
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation
by inverting the patient?

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.733
Takes days.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.064
Let's go.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:27.197
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's sator's.

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.403
How long is she gonna live on this side?

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.068
Three hours, tops.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.736
I'm taking her through.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.996
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:37.123
There's no way of bringing you back.

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:38.874
We find another machine.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.455
A week ago? Where?

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.039
Oslo.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.629
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:47.918
It's impregnable.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.428
Mmm... it wasn't last week.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.097
We're going in.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:53.307
You might as well help us.

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:55.971
This is a proving window.

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.431
As you approach the turnstile,

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.292
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.351
do not enter the machine.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:01.355
Why not?

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.337
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:04.422
then you ain't getting out.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:06.437
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:08.404
See for yourself.

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:10.906
There's your answer. Let's go.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:36.954
She's stabilizing slowly.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.658
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.099
How long does she need?

01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:42.559
Four, five days. A week to be sure.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.379
Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo.

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:46.403
I'm going back out there.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:49.688
To do what?

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:52.546
To stop sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.613
You didn't. You lied about where it was.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:55.788
Wait.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:57.783
You're going out there for her.

01:28:57.958 --> 01:28:59.478
He threatened to kill her in the past.

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:01.106
If he does, what happens to her here?

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.619
That's unknowable.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:07.026
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:08.335
What do you believe?

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:10.626
What's happened's happened.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:13.591
We need to save her, here and now.

01:29:13.765 --> 01:29:16.723
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.263
Don't let them
take her back through there.

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:20.476
Okay?

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:22.145
We can't stay here.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:24.731
We don't have a lot of time.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:27.984
So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:30.236
that's just come off a ship from Oslo?

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:31.817
This is cowboy shit.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:33.469
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:34.613
if you go through that door.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:36.609
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.028
Wheeler, brief him.

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:40.079
You'll need your own air.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:43.413
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

01:29:43.587 --> 01:29:44.702
Number one rule:

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.371
Don't come into contact
with your forward self.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:50.040
It's the whole point of these barriers
and protective suits.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.628
We don't have time.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:53.839
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.014
What?

01:29:55.098 --> 01:29:56.098
Annihilation.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.089
That would be bad, right?

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:01.977
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:03.432
Things will feel strange.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.644
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:09.852
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.607
as the transfer of heat is reversed.

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:15.740
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.240
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:20.654
This is normal.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.493
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:24.267
I can't vouch for the handling.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:25.955
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.712
You are inverted. The world is not.

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:30.497
Was the transponder on the case?

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:32.336
We've tossed that case.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.967
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:36.799
Give me the reader.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.134
Okay.

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:44.473
You ready?

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.685
The material's not in the case.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:42.276
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:44.574
He was lying.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.450
It wasn't in the BMW.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:47.621
So, where is it?

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.788
I saw the handoff.

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:38.419
You made me shoot her for nothing.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.128
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:44.839
Not even my wife.

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.999
You left ives and his team
a hell of a cleanup.

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:20.287
Heat transfer was reversed.

01:35:21.174 --> 01:35:22.960
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:25.212
from a gasoline explosion in history.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.965
At this point,
nothing surprises.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:30.756
We're headed back to Oslo?

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:32.799
In a rotas shipping container.

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:34.306
He's got the material, Nell.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:36.935
I handed it to him on a plate.

01:35:37.232 --> 01:35:38.563
I warned you...

01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:39.848
What's happened's happened.

01:35:40.026 --> 01:35:41.562
I get it now.

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.648
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

01:35:45.698 --> 01:35:46.528
That's not fair.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:48.781
You were a part of this before we met.

01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:50.615
Were you working for priya?

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:51.575
No.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:52.986
Who recruited you, Neil?

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.660
It can't possibly do you any good
to know that right now.

01:35:56.834 --> 01:36:01.669
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

01:36:01.839 --> 01:36:04.455
then you can hear my life story, okay?

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:08.464
I'm sorry I involved you.

01:36:08.638 --> 01:36:10.344
You need to tell me what's going on.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.222
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

01:36:13.393 --> 01:36:14.393
Good luck, pal.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.393
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in priya's eyes.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:20.020
In priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:22.307
She has the right to know
why she might die.

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:23.565
Am I gonna die?

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.336
Not if we have something
to say about it.

01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:26.405
And we do.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.154
Who are you?

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:32.817
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:41.125
The material's not in the case.

01:36:41.254 --> 01:36:44.417
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:54.551
You injured?

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:02.347
What's the algorithm, Neil?

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.402
2411s one section of it.
One out of nine.

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:11.067
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:12.899
so it can't be copied or communicated.

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:15.617
It's a black box with one function.

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:17.862
Which is?

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:21.492
Inversion. But not objects or peoples.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.749
The world around us.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.920
I don't understand.

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:27.205
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:31.001
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:34.216
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:35.515
We dominate.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.264
They're always swimming upstream.

01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:38.550
It's what saved your life.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:41.344
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:42.689
Pissing in the wind.

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:45.644
And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:48.184
It can invert the entropy of the world.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:50.145
And if that happens?

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:51.483
Oh...

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.315
End of play.

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:55.908
"End of play.”
can you be a little more precise?

01:37:56.079 --> 01:37:59.537
Everyone and everything
that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:00.707
Precise enough?

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.490
Including my son.

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.754
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:25.850
On a truck.

01:38:28.194 --> 01:38:29.479
Shouldn't be long now.

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:32.813
I've been thinking.

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:34.821
We're their ancestors.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.525
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:40.119
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:41.449
The what?

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:43.785
If you went back in time

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.240
and killed your own grandfather,

01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:47.372
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

01:38:47.547 --> 01:38:48.377
What's the answer?

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:50.129
There's no answer. It's a paradox.

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800
But in the future,

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.715
those in power clearly believe
that you can

01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:55.171
kick grandpa down the stairs,

01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:56.961
gouge his eyes out,

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.300
slit his throat,

01:38:58.474 --> 01:38:59.589
without consequence.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:01.799
Could they be right?

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:03.434
Doesn't matter.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.344
They believe it.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:07.514
So they're willing to destroy us.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.941
Can I go back to sleep now?

01:39:11.112 --> 01:39:12.392
No. I thought of something else.

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:13.360
Great.

01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.647
This reversing the flow of time.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.445
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:19.654
That we stop them?

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.699
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:24.497
Pessimistically?

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:27.409
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:30.495
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:31.913
Does your head hurt yet?

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:33.251
Yes.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.590
Try to sleep.

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:54.860
Shit.

01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:58.238
They didn't take us inside.

01:39:59.494 --> 01:40:01.109
What do we do?

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:05.499
We use the breach.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.782
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

01:40:10.755 --> 01:40:12.245
She healed enough?

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:14.880
I don't know.

01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:16.507
I've never done this before.

01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:19.085
The fire crew's there.

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:20.548
You take Kat through the breach,

01:40:20.765 --> 01:40:22.645
I take care of sator's men
and secure the vault.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:24.215
Then you bring her in.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:26.770
How's your arm?

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:28.474
Not good.

01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:34.858
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

01:40:39.492 --> 01:40:40.572
Hold on, hold on. “What?

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:41.945
You're bleeding.

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:44.143
All right, let me take a look at it.

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:51.670
Ready?

01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:26.182
Wait here. I'm going in.

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:24.656
Come on!

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:25.984
Go, go, go!

01:43:56.313 --> 01:43:57.313
Go!

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:41.311
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:42.575
Why didn't you say?

01:45:42.753 --> 01:45:43.793
That's a lot of explaining

01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:45.857
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:46.881
But afterwards?

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:50.291
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.

01:45:50.469 --> 01:45:51.629
What's happened's happened.

01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:55.258
If I told you and you acted differently,
who knows?

01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:59.053
The policy is to suppress.

01:45:59.562 --> 01:46:01.268
Whose policy?

01:46:01.438 --> 01:46:02.598
Ours, my friend.

01:46:06.277 --> 01:46:09.144
We're the people saving the world
from what might've been.

01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:20.078
Kat?

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:22.281
I'm here.

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:24.454
It'll be quite a scar.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.126
You'll be okay.

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:29.591
Did it.

01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:31.124
You did what?

01:46:31.969 --> 01:46:33.584
Andrei has the algorithm.

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:36.503
You don't know where he is.

01:46:38.684 --> 01:46:39.890
Or when.

01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:43.556
- Get priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:46.393
If I don't do something, in two days,
she tells me about the 241.

01:46:46.567 --> 01:46:47.727
Nothing can change that.

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:49.152
We'll see.

01:46:49.945 --> 01:46:51.276
Just get her here.

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:54.988
Hello, priya.

01:46:55.951 --> 01:46:57.191
What's going on?

01:46:57.369 --> 01:46:58.779
Where's Neil?

01:46:58.954 --> 01:47:02.446
Nursing Katherine barton,
who almost died because of you.

01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:03.625
What did I do?

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:04.827
It's what you're going to do.

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:07.581
In two days, you're gonna have me
dangle plutonium-241

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:09.996
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:11.710
Now, I wanna know why.

01:47:11.884 --> 01:47:14.000
You let sator get hold of 241?

01:47:14.178 --> 01:47:15.918
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

01:47:17.556 --> 01:47:19.387
So, tell me about it, priya.

01:47:20.059 --> 01:47:22.516
It's... it's unique.

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:24.426
The scientist who built it
took her own life

01:47:24.605 --> 01:47:26.207
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

01:47:26.231 --> 01:47:27.271
A scientist in the future?

01:47:27.316 --> 01:47:28.431
Generations from now.

01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:30.019
Why does she have to kill herself?

01:47:33.447 --> 01:47:35.312
As they approached
the first atomic test,

01:47:35.407 --> 01:47:36.817
Oppenheimer became concerned

01:47:36.992 --> 01:47:39.699
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:40.905
engulfing the world.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.866
They went ahead anyway and got lucky.

01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:46.991
Think of our scientist
as her generation's Oppenheimer.

01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:49.918
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

01:47:50.089 --> 01:47:52.671
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

01:47:52.841 --> 01:47:54.297
they're destroying themselves.

01:47:54.468 --> 01:47:56.208
The grandfather paradox.

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:58.173
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

01:47:58.347 --> 01:47:59.587
she rebels,

01:47:59.765 --> 01:48:01.847
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:04.388
and hiding them
the best place she can think of.

01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:05.979
The past.

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:07.181
Here, now.

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.563
There are nine nuclear powers.

01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:10.733
Nine bombs.

01:48:11.235 --> 01:48:14.648
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

01:48:14.822 --> 01:48:16.778
The best hiding place possible.

01:48:16.949 --> 01:48:18.985
Nuclear containment facilities.

01:48:19.785 --> 01:48:21.195
Sator's lifelong mission,

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:23.827
financed and guided by the future,
has been to

01:48:23.998 --> 01:48:26.205
find and reassemble the algorithm.

01:48:26.375 --> 01:48:27.615
Why do they choose him?

01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:29.729
Because he was at the right place
at the right time.

01:48:29.753 --> 01:48:31.914
The collapse of the Soviet union.

01:48:32.089 --> 01:48:35.172
The most insecure moment
in the history of nuclear weapons.

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:37.503
How many sections does he have?

01:48:37.678 --> 01:48:39.259
After the 241, all nine.

01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:40.920
Jesus Christ.

01:48:41.515 --> 01:48:44.473
And that's why you're going
to do things differently this time.

01:48:45.436 --> 01:48:46.846
To change things?

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:48.261
So Katherine won't get hurt?

01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:50.555
So sator won't get the algorithm.

01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:54.516
If that universe can exist...

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:56.195
We don't live in it.

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:57.648
Well, let's try.

01:48:58.365 --> 01:49:00.071
You're going to warn me.

01:49:00.242 --> 01:49:01.903
No, I'm not.

01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:03.442
Ignorance is our ammunition.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.655
Come on.

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:07.071
If you had known what the algorithm was,

01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:09.365
would you have let it fall
into sator's hands?

01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:12.659
You want sator to get the last section.

01:49:12.838 --> 01:49:15.329
That is the only way
he'll bring together the other eight.

01:49:15.507 --> 01:49:17.168
I was supposed to steal it...

01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:18.714
Then lose it?

01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:20.251
Mission accomplished.

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:22.214
You used me.

01:49:23.265 --> 01:49:24.596
As you used Katherine.

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:27.178
Standard operating procedure.

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:30.052
You've done your part.

01:49:30.773 --> 01:49:31.773
My part?

01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:34.564
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

01:49:34.735 --> 01:49:35.850
You...

01:49:36.028 --> 01:49:37.814
Are a protagonist.

01:49:37.988 --> 01:49:40.821
Did you think you were the only one
capable of saving the world?

01:49:45.621 --> 01:49:46.621
No.

01:49:47.998 --> 01:49:49.408
But I am.

01:49:49.583 --> 01:49:50.623
Because I haven't told you

01:49:50.793 --> 01:49:52.704
where he's assembling the algorithm
or when.

01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:53.958
You're about to.

01:49:54.129 --> 01:49:55.539
No, I'm not.

01:49:55.714 --> 01:49:56.794
So, deal us in.

01:49:58.008 --> 01:49:59.043
"Us"?

01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:01.112
Why would you want to involve her again?

01:50:01.136 --> 01:50:02.456
Because she can get close to him.

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:03.881
Does he still trust her?

01:50:04.056 --> 01:50:05.216
He thinks she's dead.

01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:06.550
But he used to.

01:50:06.725 --> 01:50:09.011
You have started looking at the world
in a new way.

01:50:09.186 --> 01:50:10.551
And now, it's your turn.

01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:12.310
Assuming she makes it out alive,

01:50:12.397 --> 01:50:14.353
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:15.355
I can't.

01:50:15.526 --> 01:50:16.711
If you don't have the authority,

01:50:16.735 --> 01:50:19.351
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.270
I need your word

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.905
that she and her son
will be safe, priya.

01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:26.533
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:33.334
They'll be safe.

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:37.377
There's a rally point
offshore at trondheim.

01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.004
Get yourselves up there.

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:40.960
Ives has a team ready to invert.

01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:42.535
You have a turnstile?

01:50:42.594 --> 01:50:45.131
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.421
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

01:50:48.016 --> 01:50:50.302
But there are some people,
in the future,

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:53.594
who want to continue
the algorithm's journey into the past.

01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:56.271
You see...

01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:59.228
Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

01:50:59.403 --> 01:51:02.065
It will be founded in the future.

01:51:28.807 --> 01:51:30.638
Can't get over the birds.

01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:32.549
How're you feeling?

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.436
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:41.024
I can't.

01:51:41.195 --> 01:51:42.275
Why not?

01:51:42.446 --> 01:51:44.277
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

01:51:44.448 --> 01:51:46.484
Not with a dead man's switch.

01:51:46.658 --> 01:51:48.398
The fitness tracker he wears.

01:51:48.827 --> 01:51:50.107
He's obsessive about his health.

01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:51.472
It'll be linked to a switch,

01:51:51.496 --> 01:51:53.612
probably a simple e-mail burst

01:51:53.707 --> 01:51:55.387
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.331
set to fire if his heart stops.

01:51:57.502 --> 01:51:59.663
His death activates the algorithm.

01:51:59.838 --> 01:52:01.328
He dies, the world ends.

01:52:01.673 --> 01:52:03.254
No one dares kill him.

01:52:05.636 --> 01:52:07.547
No, you've missed the point.

01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:11.300
He's intending to end his life.

01:52:13.769 --> 01:52:14.769
Why?

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:17.806
He's dying.

01:52:22.527 --> 01:52:24.438
And he's taking the world with him.

01:52:24.613 --> 01:52:26.649
If he can't have her, no one can.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:30.653
He gets to choose the time and place
for the end of the world.

01:52:31.078 --> 01:52:33.490
What moment? What does he choose?

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.247
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

01:52:38.752 --> 01:52:39.958
Vietnam.

01:52:40.128 --> 01:52:41.743
You said he vanished. What day?

01:52:41.922 --> 01:52:44.692
I went ashore with Max and he flew off,
but I don't know what day it was.

01:52:44.716 --> 01:52:46.798
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:47.969
He was in Ukraine.

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:49.918
At the Kiev opera siege.

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:52.383
How do you know about that?

01:52:53.767 --> 01:52:56.087
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht,
so that's his window.

01:52:56.144 --> 01:52:58.556
To go back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.

01:52:58.730 --> 01:52:59.930
Everyone's last.

01:53:00.232 --> 01:53:02.112
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:03.185
without sator knowing.

01:53:03.277 --> 01:53:05.563
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

01:53:05.737 --> 01:53:07.193
And not the rest of us.

01:53:07.364 --> 01:53:08.444
Where's the dead drop?

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.151
Knowledge divided, my friend.

01:53:10.325 --> 01:53:11.325
You're not gonna tell me?

01:53:11.493 --> 01:53:12.613
Ignorance is our ammunition.

01:53:13.078 --> 01:53:14.659
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.

01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:15.865
Why?

01:53:16.081 --> 01:53:19.039
You have to stop him killing himself
until we know the algorithm

01:53:19.209 --> 01:53:21.074
is out of the dead drop.

01:53:21.253 --> 01:53:23.244
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.

01:53:23.422 --> 01:53:25.149
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

01:53:25.173 --> 01:53:27.164
if they're gonna be his last.

01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:29.090
They're not.

01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:55.244
It's time.

01:53:55.287 --> 01:53:56.993
We're working our way back to the 14th,

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.760
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:01.039
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:04.208
You know what a hypocenter is?

01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:07.921
It's ground zero
for an underground nuclear test.

01:54:08.091 --> 01:54:13.131
Sir Michael Crosby told me about
a detonation in stalsk-12 on the 14th.

01:54:13.305 --> 01:54:15.387
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

01:54:18.643 --> 01:54:20.330
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

01:54:20.354 --> 01:54:22.345
before the bomb goes off, en?

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:26.140
Line it up.

01:54:26.568 --> 01:54:27.568
Move forward.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:30.696
Next.

01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:35.993
Line it up.

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:38.948
Where's Neil?

01:54:42.125 --> 01:54:43.405
He must've gone through already.

01:54:43.502 --> 01:54:44.622
I didn't get to say goodbye.

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:46.751
This is goodbye, isn't it?

01:54:46.922 --> 01:54:48.287
I'd like to say...

01:54:48.799 --> 01:54:50.318
That you don't have to do this, Kat...

01:54:50.342 --> 01:54:53.709
Worst thing andrei ever did to me
was that offer he made me.

01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:56.879
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

01:54:58.225 --> 01:54:59.965
I shouted and...

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.720
Swore.

01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:04.762
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

01:55:08.193 --> 01:55:09.683
I considered it.

01:55:10.529 --> 01:55:12.736
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:14.737
or because he knows that about me.

01:55:18.161 --> 01:55:19.742
A chance to help save my child.

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:21.510
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:22.745
No.

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:24.781
You've killed people
you've hated before.

01:55:25.293 --> 01:55:26.578
It's not usually personal.

01:55:26.753 --> 01:55:28.731
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:30.370
It always counts, Kat.

01:55:30.841 --> 01:55:33.503
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:37.002
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.795
he takes us all with him.

01:55:41.518 --> 01:55:43.600
You just keep up your end, okay?

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.014
Today's the 14th.

01:55:49.276 --> 01:55:50.686
Offshore of Siberia.

01:55:50.861 --> 01:55:52.192
Time for us to go.

01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:53.642
You keep going back another day,

01:55:53.738 --> 01:55:55.524
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

01:55:55.699 --> 01:55:56.843
And who gets me on the yacht?

01:55:56.867 --> 01:55:58.147
I've got somebody good lined up.

01:55:58.243 --> 01:56:01.326
When it's over, when you're raising
your boy, carry this.

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:04.120
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:06.953
Hit "talk," state your location,
hang up.

01:56:07.419 --> 01:56:09.000
Who gets the message”?

01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:11.078
Posterity.

01:56:50.504 --> 01:56:51.835
Stalsk-12.

01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:55.372
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:59.714
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

01:56:59.888 --> 01:57:03.472
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

01:57:03.642 --> 01:57:04.927
We're red team, moving forward.

01:57:05.101 --> 01:57:07.592
In order to distinguish the teams,
you'll wear these.

01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:08.931
Our friends over there,

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:11.471
blue team, led by commander Wheeler,
are inverted.

01:57:11.650 --> 01:57:13.390
Why don't they let us see them?

01:57:13.902 --> 01:57:15.262
Maybe we won't like what happened.

01:57:15.403 --> 01:57:18.236
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.442
Then, were dropped on the Ridge
above the hypocenter,

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.827
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:29.831
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

01:57:30.001 --> 01:57:33.744
Now, this briefing
has the benefit of their experience.

01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:52.520
Both teams have countdown watches.

01:57:52.691 --> 01:57:55.057
Ours counts down from ten, from landing

01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:56.691
to zero to the explosion.

01:57:56.861 --> 01:57:58.798
- Blue team is reversed.
- Everybody, look to your left.

01:57:58.822 --> 01:58:02.815
If you are not at the lz at zero,
you are not leaving.

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:05.195
Do you understand?

01:58:05.495 --> 01:58:08.987
We drop in, clear lzs
for blue team evacuation.

01:58:09.165 --> 01:58:10.780
We make our way into the city proper.

01:58:10.917 --> 01:58:13.374
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

01:58:13.545 --> 01:58:15.001
there is a turnstile.

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:17.082
Expect a bitemporal response.

01:58:17.257 --> 01:58:18.667
They'll have inverse ordnance?

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:21.083
Inverse, conventional,

01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:23.752
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

01:58:24.472 --> 01:58:25.882
On the other side of the city,

01:58:25.974 --> 01:58:28.431
the ground rises to the Ridge
above the hypocenter.

01:58:28.602 --> 01:58:31.810
A splinter unit
will take this tunnel from the city

01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.811
to the floor of the hypocenter.

01:58:33.982 --> 01:58:36.519
Blue team located an entrance here.

01:58:36.693 --> 01:58:38.729
The bomb is in this rock,

01:58:38.903 --> 01:58:41.736
high above, to trigger a collapse,

01:58:41.906 --> 01:58:42.941
sealing the cavern.

01:58:43.116 --> 01:58:44.572
How do we defuse the bomb up there?

01:58:44.659 --> 01:58:47.241
We don't.
The explosion takes place as planned.

01:58:47.412 --> 01:58:51.246
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

01:58:51.416 --> 01:58:54.783
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

01:58:54.919 --> 01:58:55.919
Which is?

01:58:56.004 --> 01:58:57.124
Need-to-know, and you don't.

01:58:58.089 --> 01:58:59.750
Any other stupid questions?

01:59:00.133 --> 01:59:02.419
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.

01:59:05.347 --> 01:59:06.757
I wanted to be on the first wave.

01:59:06.931 --> 01:59:08.296
There 1s no first wave.

01:59:08.475 --> 01:59:10.932
Red team and blue team
operate simultaneously.

01:59:11.102 --> 01:59:12.102
Look,

01:59:12.187 --> 01:59:14.867
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

01:59:15.023 --> 01:59:18.436
Now, you wanna be on the team
that lifts the contents of the capsule?

01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:20.100
Absolutely.

01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:22.147
Yeah, that's us.

01:59:22.906 --> 01:59:24.146
We're splinter unit.

01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:25.404
Just us?

01:59:26.117 --> 01:59:29.075
No one who knows the contents
of that capsule can leave the field.

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:32.453
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

01:59:42.342 --> 01:59:44.320
It's 40 feet
from the private deck to the water.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:45.344
Can you jump it?

01:59:45.887 --> 01:59:47.377
I can dive it.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.250
Thirty seconds!

02:01:08.344 --> 02:01:09.344
Go! Go! Go!

02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:22.977
We're coming in on a shockwave.

02:01:23.151 --> 02:01:24.311
Hang on, people.

02:01:33.495 --> 02:01:34.780
On your feet!

02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:49.875
There!

02:02:03.107 --> 02:02:04.794
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

02:02:04.818 --> 02:02:06.338
Well, I snuck back to surprise andrei.

02:02:06.444 --> 02:02:07.444
Oh, the boss left.

02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:11.063
Well, have Mr. sator find me here.

02:02:11.241 --> 02:02:12.526
And don't tell the others.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:13.940
I'll get the mess.

02:03:21.561 --> 02:03:22.561
Mines!

02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:23.770
Mines!

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.637
They told me you'd gone ashore.

02:03:41.706 --> 02:03:42.866
They told me you'd flown off.

02:03:42.999 --> 02:03:45.115
I came back to see you and Max.

02:03:45.293 --> 02:03:47.158
Max is on shore with Anna.

02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:50.357
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

02:03:50.381 --> 02:03:52.747
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

02:03:53.468 --> 02:03:54.924
You think I'm a terrible mother.

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:58.507
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

02:04:06.439 --> 02:04:08.771
I want things to be better, andrei.

02:04:24.415 --> 02:04:25.575
Take cover!

02:04:29.963 --> 02:04:31.749
Get me a goddamn at4!

02:04:31.923 --> 02:04:33.163
Take him out, now!

02:04:33.758 --> 02:04:35.168
Provide some cover!

02:04:35.343 --> 02:04:37.174
Move, move, move! Let's go!

02:04:37.345 --> 02:04:38.630
Move, move, move!

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Wheeler!

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:52.544
Get outta there!

02:05:52.712 --> 02:05:53.872
Come on!

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:00.552
Ives!

02:06:02.638 --> 02:06:04.253
Splinter unit. Here.

02:06:06.059 --> 02:06:08.175
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

02:06:08.352 --> 02:06:12.311
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:14.931
I'll make you a drink.

02:06:15.902 --> 02:06:17.893
Bring my son back to the boat.

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.721
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!

02:06:25.745 --> 02:06:27.827
If they see us, it's all for nothing.

02:06:31.626 --> 02:06:32.741
We need a distraction.

02:06:32.919 --> 02:06:34.455
Don't worry about that.

02:06:38.132 --> 02:06:39.542
On my Mark!

02:06:42.386 --> 02:06:44.001
Rpg, hit the base!

02:06:45.056 --> 02:06:46.336
That building on my Mark!

02:06:48.226 --> 02:06:50.012
Three! Two!

02:06:50.186 --> 02:06:51.926
One! Fire!

02:06:53.064 --> 02:06:54.224
Fire!

02:07:09.205 --> 02:07:10.536
Move! Move!

02:07:26.264 --> 02:07:28.255
We're committed now. Come on.

02:07:34.564 --> 02:07:36.145
What's that?

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:38.772
I borrowed it from the CIA.

02:07:40.111 --> 02:07:41.146
What is it?

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.561
The way the world ends.

02:07:43.739 --> 02:07:46.196
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

02:07:46.617 --> 02:07:48.323
I don't understand.

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:50.405
When I take this, it's all over.

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.195
Then don't take it yet.

02:07:56.252 --> 02:07:57.867
Why not?

02:07:59.463 --> 02:08:01.374
Because we have the sunset coming.

02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:04.298
And a little vodka left.

02:08:04.468 --> 02:08:06.424
And Max will be here soon.

02:08:06.596 --> 02:08:10.589
They said they thought it was you,
not Anna, ashore with Max.

02:08:13.436 --> 02:08:16.849
So long as you can tell the difference.

02:08:19.025 --> 02:08:21.641
A moment's business, my love.

02:08:33.873 --> 02:08:35.158
Mahir, do you copy?

02:08:35.333 --> 02:08:38.370
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:39.544
Copy that.

02:08:39.795 --> 02:08:42.912
I repeat, not clear!

02:09:09.450 --> 02:09:10.530
Neil!

02:09:11.327 --> 02:09:12.407
Neill

02:09:25.299 --> 02:09:26.414
Go!

02:09:35.351 --> 02:09:38.013
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

02:09:44.318 --> 02:09:45.979
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:51.741
Anything?

02:09:51.909 --> 02:09:52.989
Nah, nothing.

02:09:53.035 --> 02:09:55.075
Here, you try having a look.
Can you pick it?

02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:57.036
I hope not.

02:09:57.206 --> 02:09:59.037
I paid a lot for that lock.

02:09:59.208 --> 02:10:01.950
How do you like where my journey began
and yours ends?

02:10:02.128 --> 02:10:03.618
Little radioactive for my taste.

02:10:03.796 --> 02:10:06.708
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

02:10:07.925 --> 02:10:10.291
We'd work where no one else would.

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.177
I made a bargain with the devil.

02:10:13.347 --> 02:10:14.928
Money for time.

02:10:15.099 --> 02:10:17.010
We sold our futures.

02:10:17.184 --> 02:10:19.926
And now you're about to make
the same mistake for the entire world.

02:10:20.604 --> 02:10:23.391
It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.

02:10:23.566 --> 02:10:24.772
What was yours?

02:10:24.942 --> 02:10:27.433
You fight for a cause
you barely understand...

02:10:28.195 --> 02:10:31.687
With people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.

02:10:31.866 --> 02:10:33.948
When I die, the world dies with me.

02:10:34.118 --> 02:10:36.200
And your knowledge dies with you,

02:10:36.370 --> 02:10:39.862
buried in a tomb
like an anonymous Egyptian builder

02:10:40.041 --> 02:10:42.453
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.

02:10:42.626 --> 02:10:45.038
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

02:11:05.775 --> 02:11:08.337
What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?

02:11:08.361 --> 02:11:10.773
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.

02:11:11.364 --> 02:11:15.198
Somewhere, sometime, a man
in a crystalline tower throws a switch

02:11:15.785 --> 02:11:19.369
and armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:22.905
Now time itself switches direction.

02:11:23.084 --> 02:11:25.416
The same sunshine we basked in

02:11:25.586 --> 02:11:29.420
will warm the faces of our descendants
generations to come.

02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:31.501
How could they wanna kill us?

02:11:31.675 --> 02:11:34.838
Because their oceans Rose
and their rivers ran dry.

02:11:35.012 --> 02:11:38.596
Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.

02:11:39.225 --> 02:11:41.181
We're responsible.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.231
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

02:11:58.536 --> 02:11:59.616
Yes.

02:12:00.287 --> 02:12:02.323
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

02:12:02.498 --> 02:12:04.329
That's exactly what they're doing.

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.661
But not you. You're a traitor.

02:12:06.836 --> 02:12:09.748
Bringing death to all, because
you have no life of your own left.

02:12:09.922 --> 02:12:11.628
When I'm done, life continues.

02:12:11.799 --> 02:12:13.380
Not your son's.

02:12:13.551 --> 02:12:17.169
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

02:12:17.346 --> 02:12:19.132
You think god will forgive me?

02:12:24.979 --> 02:12:26.094
Walit!

02:12:27.106 --> 02:12:28.106
Wait!

02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:30.515
God...

02:12:41.829 --> 02:12:43.365
Cover me!

02:12:51.255 --> 02:12:53.086
Go! Go! Gol

02:12:54.925 --> 02:12:57.541
you don't believe in god, or a future,

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.672
or anything outside
of your own experience.

02:12:59.847 --> 02:13:02.259
The rest is belief.

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:04.764
And I don't have it.

02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:07.305
Without it, you're not human.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.890
You're just a madman.

02:13:09.523 --> 02:13:11.514
Or a god.

02:13:11.692 --> 02:13:12.522
Of sorts.

02:13:12.693 --> 02:13:13.728
Like I said.

02:13:16.989 --> 02:13:18.479
Don't. Jesus.

02:13:19.116 --> 02:13:20.322
Our time is up.

02:13:27.082 --> 02:13:29.038
I'll give your love to my wife.

02:13:29.710 --> 02:13:31.575
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

02:13:32.129 --> 02:13:33.129
That's right.

02:13:33.255 --> 02:13:34.870
After you meet her, she dies.

02:13:35.049 --> 02:13:37.506
I'll just give her my love instead.

02:13:38.802 --> 02:13:39.802
Don't do...

02:13:41.263 --> 02:13:42.673
Volkov...

02:13:56.195 --> 02:13:57.981
Enough business, my love.

02:14:25.182 --> 02:14:27.798
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:32.602
But it sounds terribly important.

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:35.973
Where are you going?

02:14:36.151 --> 02:14:37.391
Aren't you hot?

02:14:54.128 --> 02:14:55.163
What are you doing now?

02:14:55.671 --> 02:14:57.036
I spilled sunscreen.

02:14:57.590 --> 02:14:59.421
- So what?
- Slippery!

02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:04.171
Just come here.

02:15:07.433 --> 02:15:08.433
Turn over.

02:15:08.809 --> 02:15:10.174
You'll like it.

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.085
I can't do this.

02:15:47.222 --> 02:15:49.659
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

02:15:49.683 --> 02:15:52.363
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

02:15:55.064 --> 02:15:56.520
You're dying alone, andrei.

02:15:56.607 --> 02:15:57.876
Come on, come on, come on!

02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:00.232
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.

02:16:00.736 --> 02:16:02.226
Mahir, do you copy?

02:16:02.696 --> 02:16:03.526
Yeanh.

02:16:03.697 --> 02:16:05.528
Hold. I repeat, hold!

02:16:10.871 --> 02:16:11.906
Look in my eyes.

02:16:13.457 --> 02:16:14.913
Which do you see?

02:16:16.043 --> 02:16:18.955
Despair or anger?

02:16:20.547 --> 02:16:22.503
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:24.547
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

02:16:26.345 --> 02:16:30.179
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

02:16:33.394 --> 02:16:34.394
No!

02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:54.580
Shit.

02:16:54.998 --> 02:16:57.678
Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:00.785
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

02:17:19.231 --> 02:17:21.768
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.440
Ah, screw it.

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:40.680
Kat! You jumped the gun!

02:18:40.854 --> 02:18:42.515
I couldn't do it.

02:18:42.689 --> 02:18:44.680
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:46.982
I knew you'd find a way.

02:18:47.736 --> 02:18:49.567
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

02:18:49.738 --> 02:18:51.854
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.

02:19:13.595 --> 02:19:14.835
Thought you were inverted.

02:19:15.222 --> 02:19:16.928
Changed gears halfway.

02:19:18.433 --> 02:19:20.139
Looked like you needed help here.

02:19:20.310 --> 02:19:22.426
Here? We needed help down there.

02:19:23.730 --> 02:19:24.936
How'd you get that lock open?

02:19:25.983 --> 02:19:28.065
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?

02:19:29.152 --> 02:19:30.858
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

02:19:31.655 --> 02:19:32.655
All right, ives?

02:19:33.198 --> 02:19:35.038
Once I've caught my breath.

02:19:49.131 --> 02:19:51.497
No one who's seen this leaves the field.

02:20:00.392 --> 02:20:01.882
All right.

02:20:05.397 --> 02:20:06.762
We hide it.

02:20:07.649 --> 02:20:09.139
We end our lives.

02:20:09.902 --> 02:20:12.109
That's the only way to be sure.

02:20:13.864 --> 02:20:15.729
As to when...

02:20:16.158 --> 02:20:18.524
Maybe that's every man's decision
to make for himself.

02:20:19.661 --> 02:20:20.946
You're not gonna kill us?

02:20:21.121 --> 02:20:23.487
If I ever find you, I will.

02:20:23.665 --> 02:20:25.121
But you won't look too hard?

02:20:26.168 --> 02:20:27.328
Yes, I will.

02:20:31.131 --> 02:20:33.234
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

02:20:33.258 --> 02:20:34.088
No.

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:35.795
It's far too dangerous.

02:20:36.637 --> 02:20:38.218
Even from afar?

02:20:39.473 --> 02:20:40.883
Even from afar.

02:20:43.185 --> 02:20:44.345
Ives!

02:20:45.354 --> 02:20:46.594
Wait.

02:20:52.945 --> 02:20:54.435
Are you really going back in?

02:20:57.324 --> 02:21:00.157
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, ives?

02:21:00.535 --> 02:21:02.992
Well, I don't know any locksmiths
as good as you.

02:21:04.456 --> 02:21:05.536
See?

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:08.122
It's me in there, again.

02:21:08.752 --> 02:21:11.664
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

02:21:20.263 --> 02:21:21.263
Neil, wait!

02:21:25.644 --> 02:21:27.259
Just saved the world.

02:21:27.771 --> 02:21:29.636
Can't leave anything to chance.

02:21:30.232 --> 02:21:32.473
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:35.358
"What's happened's happened.”

02:21:35.529 --> 02:21:38.521
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

02:21:39.199 --> 02:21:40.735
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:42.156
Fate?

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:43.658
Call it what you want.

02:21:44.121 --> 02:21:45.121
What do you call it?

02:21:45.998 --> 02:21:47.113
Reality.

02:21:49.793 --> 02:21:51.078
Now let me go.

02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:59.337
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

02:21:59.511 --> 02:22:01.217
Haven't you guessed by now?

02:22:02.222 --> 02:22:03.222
You did.

02:22:03.932 --> 02:22:06.469
Only not when you thought.

02:22:06.643 --> 02:22:08.975
You have a future in the past.

02:22:09.146 --> 02:22:12.104
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:14.560
You've known me for years?

02:22:16.403 --> 02:22:20.191
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:22.151
But for me, it's just the beginning.

02:22:22.868 --> 02:22:24.779
We get up to some stuff.

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:27.660
You're gonna love it. You'll see.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:30.781
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:32.616
Whose?

02:22:34.087 --> 02:22:35.087
Yours!

02:22:35.881 --> 02:22:37.417
You're only halfway there.

02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:39.377
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

02:22:48.185 --> 02:22:51.348
We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

02:22:51.521 --> 02:22:53.281
World will never know
what could've happened.

02:22:55.275 --> 02:22:58.062
And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.

02:23:02.365 --> 02:23:04.606
'Cause no one cares
about the bomb that didn't go off.

02:23:06.161 --> 02:23:07.367
Only the one that did.

02:23:09.998 --> 02:23:11.238
Do it before the boy comes out.

02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:17.123
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

02:23:17.297 --> 02:23:20.334
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

02:23:20.842 --> 02:23:22.707
Here, today.

02:23:24.096 --> 02:23:25.586
How did you know?

02:23:27.724 --> 02:23:30.306
Cannon place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

02:23:30.811 --> 02:23:31.641
Posterity.

02:23:31.812 --> 02:23:35.270
Cannon place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

02:23:36.108 --> 02:23:39.020
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

02:23:39.903 --> 02:23:42.736
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

02:23:42.823 --> 02:23:43.983
Then whose was it?

02:23:44.074 --> 02:23:45.484
Mine.

02:23:45.659 --> 02:23:48.742
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:51.285
I'm the protagonist.

02:23:53.834 --> 02:23:55.825
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

02:23:59.714 --> 02:24:01.124
Mission accomplished.

02:24:03.218 --> 02:24:04.818
It's the bomb that didn't go off.

02:24:05.595 --> 02:24:08.052
The danger no one knew was real.

02:24:13.603 --> 02:24:16.436
That's the bomb
with the real power to change the world.

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:39.576
You

02:24:40.755 --> 02:24:45.749
don't know where we stand

02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:52.389
it's true

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:58.933
know the plan

02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:04.647
last time I wrecked it
last time I whipped around

02:25:04.738 --> 02:25:07.571
last time I did the whippelts
last time I live reverse

02:25:07.657 --> 02:25:10.490
pour the brown, hit the reverend
last time I hit your crib

02:25:10.577 --> 02:25:11.987
last time there weren't no tenants

02:25:12.078 --> 02:25:14.194
I done went back in myself
felt like hell

02:25:14.289 --> 02:25:15.825
felt like I risked it
pace yourself

02:25:15.916 --> 02:25:18.123
found you livin', know you thrillin"
not for sinnin"

02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:21.043
how I got my stripes and pendants
backin' out in the street

02:25:21.129 --> 02:25:23.962
what is wild, let it be
ragers out, gotta eat

02:25:24.049 --> 02:25:27.041
not a vibe, but a wave
with the sound, by the way

02:25:27.135 --> 02:25:28.591
count it down, by the days

02:25:28.678 --> 02:25:30.964
to myself, know they wicked
with the moves

02:25:31.056 --> 02:25:33.263
I'm drinkin', off the juice
know I'm drinkin'

02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:36.638
I be smooth, then I lose it
yeah, yeah, now

02:25:36.728 --> 02:25:39.765
you

02:25:40.774 --> 02:25:45.768
don't know where we stand

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:48.778
yeah, yeah

02:25:48.865 --> 02:25:53.404
it's true

02:25:53.495 --> 02:25:57.989
know the plan

02:26:01.795 --> 02:26:03.376
close the opera

02:26:03.463 --> 02:26:06.250
hear the red and blue outside
I think our option's up

02:26:06.341 --> 02:26:09.174
I recrossed it 'round the map
I had to line it up

02:26:09.261 --> 02:26:12.094
I be swervin' on the waves
it's like a line of us

02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:15.047
move in 'verse on my turf
I'm outta line, I put in work

02:26:15.141 --> 02:26:16.756
I draw the line and cross it first

02:26:16.851 --> 02:26:18.216
I need the time, I need to search

02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:19.801
it's just like wine, it make it worse

02:26:19.896 --> 02:26:21.978
skrrt, skrrt in the 'vert
skrrt, skrrt

02:26:22.065 --> 02:26:24.272
ride on land, boeing jet, make it land

02:26:24.359 --> 02:26:25.815
in slow motion when I dance

02:26:25.902 --> 02:26:28.814
in your eyes I see your trance
I run away and then you prance

02:26:28.905 --> 02:26:31.817
if I show the hideaway
will you hide out and let it blam?

02:26:31.908 --> 02:26:36.777
Ain't no time, I'm facin' scams
nah, nah

02:26:36.871 --> 02:26:39.613
you

02:26:40.834 --> 02:26:45.828
don't know where we stand

02:26:46.589 --> 02:26:47.874
yeah

02:26:47.966 --> 02:26:52.460
it's true

02:26:54.556 --> 02:26:59.220
ooh

02:27:12.449 --> 02:27:15.691
You
