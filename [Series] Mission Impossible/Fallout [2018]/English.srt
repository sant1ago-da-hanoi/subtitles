1
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,170
Do you, Ethan, take Julia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,255
I do.

3
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:50,218
To have, to hold,
to love, cherish, honor, and protect?

4
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,761
I do.

5
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,974
To shield from terrors known
and unknown?

6
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,144
- To lie, to deceive...
- What?

7
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:03,231
To live a double life,
to fail to prevent her abduction,

8
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,943
erase her identity, force her into hiding,

9
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,486
take away all she has known...

10
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,571
Stop.

11
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:11,156
...in a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt...

12
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,323
Stop.

13
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,951
...to escape your own true self?

14
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,077
Please, stop.

15
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,496
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

16
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,581
Don't.

17
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,125
- I do.
- No.

18
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:25,754
You should have killed me, Ethan.

19
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,785
Fate whispers to the warrior...

20
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,287
A storm is coming.

21
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,623
And the warrior whispers back...

22
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,627
I am the storm.

23
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,871
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

24
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,165
<i>The anarchist Solomon Lane.</i>

25
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,209
<i>Since you captured him 2 years ago,</i>

26
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:50,380
<i>his absence from the world stage
has had unintended consequences.</i>

27
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:54,968
<i>His Syndicate of rogue covert operatives
continues to wreak havoc around the globe.</i>

28
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,928
<i>The CIA's Special Activities Division</i>

29
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>has relentlessly hunted Lane's
elite network of hostiles.</i>

30
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,559
<i>But many remain unknown and at large.</i>

31
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,769
<i>The remnants of this
extremist splinter cell</i>

32
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,272
<i>refer to themselves as "The Apostles."</i>

33
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,442
<i>They have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,</i>

34
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,778
<i>making them an even greater threat.</i>

35
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,197
<i>They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak</i>

36
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,615
<i>in Indian-controlled Kashmir,</i>

37
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,993
<i>along the borders of China and Pakistan,</i>

38
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,453
<i>threatening one-third
of the world's population.</i>

39
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,539
<i>The epidemic is being contained,</i>

40
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,082
<i>but intelligence would indicate</i>

41
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:30,545
<i>that a new client has hired the Apostles
for a more ambitious operation.</i>

42
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,380
<i>They have been contacted by this man,</i>

43
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,175
<i>an unidentified extremist
known only by the code name John Lark,</i>

44
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,344
<i>author of this apocalyptic manifesto</i>

45
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,972
<i>calling for the destruction
of the current world order.</i>

46
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,726
<i>It is believed Lark is responsible
for the disappearance</i>

47
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,979
<i>of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist Nils Delbruuk.</i>

48
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,148
<i>Dr. Delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked</i>

49
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,151
<i>after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.</i>

50
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,236
<i>Meanwhile, the Apostles
have been in contact</i>

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,572
<i>with elements of
the Eastern European underworld,</i>

52
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,033
<i>who are in possession
of three plutonium cores</i>

53
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,869
<i>stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.</i>

54
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,788
<i>This would indicate that
John Lark and the Apostles</i>

55
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:09,709
<i>are working together
to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.</i>

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,587
<i>NEST estimates that a man
with Delbruuk's knowledge,</i>

57
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,963
<i>using the materials in play,</i>

58
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:18,426
<i>could complete three nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.</i>

59
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,219
<i>These devices would be man-portable</i>

60
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,805
<i>and deployable anywhere
on Earth overnight.</i>

61
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,391
<i>In the hands of John Lark
and the Apostles,</i>

62
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,769
<i>these weapons represent
an unprecedented threat</i>

63
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,562
<i>to countless millions.</i>

64
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:32,357
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,026
<i>is to prevent the Apostles
from acquiring plutonium</i>

66
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,612
<i>using any means at your disposal.</i>

67
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:41,449
<i>If you or any members of your IMF team
are caught or killed,</i>

68
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,577
<i>the Secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

69
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,745
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

70
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,957
<i>This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

71
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,431
He's late.

72
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,559
- He's never late.
- He'll be here.

73
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,019
I don't like it.

74
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:13,690
Something about this guy
just really gives me the creeps.

75
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,775
Okay, just relax.

76
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,193
I'm relaxed.

77
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,361
You don't sound relaxed.

78
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,779
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

79
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,823
He sounds terrified.

80
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,450
<i>Please, I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling is all.</i>

81
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,285
<i>I thought you said you were relaxed.</i>

82
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,872
It's entirely possible to be relaxed
and extremely uneasy at the same time.

83
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,791
- No, it's not.
- You do it all the time.

84
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,459
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

85
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,669
No, he doesn't.

86
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,629
I'm supposed to believe that
you are perfectly relaxed,

87
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,131
-right here, now...
- Benji.

88
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,551
...in a dark alleyway, waiting to buy
black-market plutonium from a psychopath.

89
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,302
Benji, I won't let anything happen to you.

90
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,804
<i>- Okay.
- See, Benji,</i>

91
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,222
<i>you're perfectly safe.</i>

92
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,182
That's easy for you to say,
you're in the van.

93
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,018
Well, you wanted to be
in the field, tough guy.

94
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,145
And tonight, Luther,
I would like to be in the van!

95
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,771
He's here.

96
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,398
Oh, God.

97
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,123
<i>Have that money ready, Luther.</i>

98
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,458
COPY-

99
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,547
Ethan, do you copy?

100
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,215
Do you COPY?

101
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,147
Are we finally gonna
do this or not?

102
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:46,324
I have survived in this business
with the help of a voice in my head.

103
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,496
This voice is never wrong.
And whenever I meet you,

104
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,790
it tells me the same thing.

105
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:55,833
What's that?

106
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,086
Nothing.

107
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,636
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip a coin.

108
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,418
What's that?

109
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,796
This is a beryllium rod, which is causing

110
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,799
a reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

111
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,017
That's them.

112
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,021
The money?

113
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:01,691
The money.

114
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,862
Bring the money.

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,042
Luther, bring the money.

116
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,720
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

117
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,555
Kill them.

118
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,228
' Qot it!

119
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,483
Luther, do you copy?

120
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,693
Luther!

121
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,195
Luther, come in.

122
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,113
<i>Luther's not here right now.</i>

123
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:52,533
<i>What can the Apostles
do for you, Hunt?</i>

124
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,911
- What <i>do you want?
- You're boxed in, Hunt.</i>

125
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,497
<i>Give us the plutonium
and walk away.</i>

126
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,625
Benji, get the car.

127
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,293
- I don't think I can do that.
- Benji.

128
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,086
Get the car.

129
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,317
We'll make you a deal, Hunt.

130
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,238
Give us the plutonium
and we won't kill your friend.

131
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,743
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

132
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,466
I'm gonna count to three.

133
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,343
One.

134
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,763
- Two.
- Luther...

135
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,932
-...I'm sorry.
- Three.

136
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,408
I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.

137
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:16,867
We're good.

138
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,581
- You okay?
- I should be dead.

139
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,583
We should all be dead.

140
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,920
Why aren't we?

141
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,964
Where's the plutonium?

142
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,602
It's gone.

143
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,442
<i>If you're just joining us,</i>

144
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,821
<i>three massive explosions
have gone off simultaneously</i>

145
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,532
<i>in what appears to be
a coordinated attack.</i>

146
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,785
<i>This image is live in Rome,
looking toward the Vatican</i>

147
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,204
<i>and is as close as our cameras can get.</i>

148
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:05,416
<i>It is believed that
the Pope was in residence</i>

149
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,751
<i>at the time of the blast.</i>

150
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,921
<i>Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem
from just outside the city.</i>

151
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,299
<i>Also live, the holy city of Mecca</i>

152
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:18,137
<i>from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Red Sea
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.</i>

153
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,222
<i>Radiation has been detected,</i>

154
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,351
<i>indicating that
nuclear weapons were used</i>

155
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,227
<i>in these unspeakable attacks.</i>

156
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,480
Ethan, it's time.

157
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,939
<i>No word on casualties yet,
but we can assume</i>

158
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,691
<i>the death toll is catastrophic.</i>

159
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>Early reports suggest
the weapons used</i>

160
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,696
<i>would require
highly specialized knowledge</i>

161
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,406
<i>that very few people possess.</i>

162
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,661
<i>The question now is who would attack
all three of these holy sites? And why?</i>

163
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,165
<i>The attacks occurred
at precisely the same moment,</i>

164
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,416
<i>just over an hour ago,</i>

165
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,335
<i>at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</i>

166
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,920
<i>Within minutes of the attack,</i>

167
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,381
<i>Congress ordered
an emergency recess</i>

168
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,132
<i>and the Capitol Building
was evacuated.</i>

169
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:58,010
<i>The President left Washington
on Air Force One.</i>

170
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,388
<i>The White House has declared
a state of emergency,</i>

171
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,765
<i>placing the military on highest alert.</i>

172
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,975
Would you excuse us, please?

173
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,270
Dr. Delbruuk.

174
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,315
We know who you are.

175
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,193
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

176
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,080
"There has never been peace

177
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,165
"without first a great suffering.

178
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,626
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

179
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,045
See, this will unite them.

180
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,799
When they read this manifesto,
they'll all understand.

181
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,593
Nobody's gonna read that manifesto, ever.

182
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,554
I can promise you that.

183
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,972
What day is it?

184
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,640
How long have I been here?

185
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,350
What's the last thing you remember?

186
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,478
I was driving.

187
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,481
Someone hit me.

188
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,233
That was two weeks ago.

189
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,235
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

190
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,154
This is yours, isn't it?

191
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,865
It's how Lark communicated with you.

192
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,200
- Lark?
- John Lark.

193
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,536
- We know all about him.
- You know nothing.

194
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,247
There's information in this phone
that could lead us to him.

195
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,040
And you have the passcode.

196
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,418
You think Lark is the enemy?

197
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,837
But you,

198
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,965
well, whoever you are, you are the enemy.

199
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,633
You're why the system survives.

200
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,678
- Why the suffering goes on.
- Shut up!

201
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,181
We don't care about you.
We want Lark.

202
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,515
What if we make a deal?

203
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,892
No, there's no deal, Luther.

204
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,935
Step outside.

205
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,354
Give me five minutes with this guy.

206
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,940
Ethan, I can't let you do that.
That's not who we are.

207
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,568
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

208
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,987
What if they read
the manifesto on the air?

209
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,071
What? You can do that?

210
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,740
We can do it with a phone call.

211
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,660
Well, if he reads Lark's manifesto...

212
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,745
No.

213
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,538
I'll give you the passcode.

214
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,624
Ethan! Ethan!

215
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,417
Think, Ethan.

216
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,294
Think of the greater good, please.

217
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,171
Yeah, you do that.

218
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:11,936
Sir.

219
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,188
No, he won't cooperate.

220
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,025
Yes, sir. If we read the manifesto

221
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,569
on the air.

222
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,573
I'm sorry, sir.

223
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,667
<i>Trading and global markets plummeted.</i>

224
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,672
<i>Stand by. I'm told we're about
to get some additional information.</i>

225
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,260
<i>I've just been handed a document
from Nils Delbruuk,</i>

226
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,303
<i>a nuclear weapons specialist</i>

227
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,431
<i>who claims to have built the weapons
used in these attacks.</i>

228
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,477
<i>I've been asked to read
this manifesto in its entirety.</i>

229
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,729
<i>"There has never been peace</i>

230
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,481
<i>"without first a great suffering.</i>

231
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,942
<i>"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.</i>

232
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,946
<i>"As mankind is drawn
to his self-destruction</i>

233
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,781
<i>"like a moth to the candle,</i>

234
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,741
<i>"the so-called defenders of peace,</i>

235
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,661
<i>"the church, the government, the law,</i>

236
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,747
<i>"work tirelessly
to save humanity from itself."</i>

237
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,374
It's not gonna help you now.

238
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,251
<i>"But by averting disaster,</i>

239
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,961
<i>"they serve to delay a peace..."</i>

240
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,254
What's done is done.

241
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,424
<i>"...that can only come through
an inevitable baptism of fire.</i>

242
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,719
<i>"The suffering I bring you
is not the beginning of the end.</i>

243
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:27,886
<i>"It is the beginning</i>

244
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,263
<i>"of a greater mutual understanding..."</i>

245
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,681
Did we get it?

246
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,100
<i>"It is the first step</i>

247
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,560
<i>"toward the ultimate
brotherhood of man."</i>

248
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,769
We got it.

249
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,354
<i>"The suffering I bring you</i>

250
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,981
<i>"is the bridge to ultimate peace."</i>

251
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,733
Go.

252
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,040
Did we get it?

253
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,708
Of course we got it.

254
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,468
I told you we'd get it.

255
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,887
I don't understand.

256
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,139
The attacks didn't happen?

257
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,934
The car accident you were in,
that was an hour ago.

258
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,811
I was driving the other car.

259
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,064
What's done is done,

260
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,899
when we say it's done.

261
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,015
Sir.

262
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,144
That phone you unlocked led us
to a server in Iceland

263
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,104
where we managed to
decrypt a communique

264
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,773
between John Lark
and this woman:

265
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,317
Alana Mitsopolis,
activist and philanthropist,

266
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,527
whose charity work

267
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,987
has earned her
the nickname the White Widow.

268
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,699
It's all a front for her real trade:
arms dealing, money laundering.

269
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,326
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

270
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,786
Lark and the Widow
are meeting tonight

271
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,956
to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,

272
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,917
which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

273
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,004
They'll make contact in a private lounge
at the Grand Palais in Paris

274
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,589
during her annual
fundraising event.

275
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,882
The details are in the file.

276
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,133
If Lark isn't there by midnight,

277
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,177
the Widow will leave

278
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,887
and sell the package
to the highest bidder.

279
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,515
Which gives you
two hours from now to find Lark.

280
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,934
Sir, I think there's something
you need to know.

281
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,644
I'm gonna stop you right there.

282
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,481
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

283
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,274
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

284
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,318
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

285
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:33,155
Some flaw deep in your core being

286
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,658
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

287
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,368
You see that as a sign of weakness.

288
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,079
To me, that's your greatest strength.

289
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,916
It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.

290
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,169
Because coming over here from the CIA
was a lateral move, some say a step down.

291
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,670
But I did it

292
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,672
because of you.

293
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,841
Don't make me regret it.

294
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,438
Make the call.

295
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,401
Shut 'em down.

296
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,330
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

297
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,915
It may be your mission,

298
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,084
but this is the CIA's plane.

299
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,877
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

300
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,212
We don't have time for this.

301
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,799
I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark
as soon as he leaves the Palais.

302
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,760
A G5 standing by
to rendition him to Gitmo,

303
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,011
where a waterboard is waiting.

304
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,598
Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust

305
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,852
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

306
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,604
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

307
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,357
This scenario is precisely
why the IMF exists!

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,818
The IMF is Halloween, Alan.

309
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,613
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.

310
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,157
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

311
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,285
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

312
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,661
And his team would be dead.

313
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,705
Yes. They would.

314
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,123
That's the job.

315
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,710
And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene

316
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,837
to appraise the situation.

317
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,506
Agent Walker,
Special Activities.

318
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,009
His reputation precedes.

319
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,802
You use a scalpel.

320
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,471
I prefer a hammer.

321
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:22,723
The answer is no.

322
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,517
I have operational authority here,
direct from the President.

323
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,810
You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

324
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,480
I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes

325
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,608
OF HO 0H6 goes.

326
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,659
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

327
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,787
Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone.

328
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,142
<i>The White Widow has spies
at every level of government.</i>

329
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,645
This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner

330
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,897
so we can jump into France undetected.

331
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,067
The Widow's meeting Lark
in the VIP lounge at midnight.

332
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,153
No one will be admitted
without a pre-issued electronic l.D. band.

333
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,614
We have acquired
the unique RFID number

334
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,699
for Lark's band,
allowing us to locate it

335
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,743
with these.

336
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,329
Find that l.D. band, you find Lark.

337
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,498
Then what?

338
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,502
Then...

339
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,798
I assume his identity
and make contact with the Widow.

340
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,299
She takes us to the package.

341
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,469
People actually fall for this shit?

342
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,806
How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?

343
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,559
I bump him in the crowd.

344
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,646
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

345
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,564
incoherent and completely pliable.

346
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,191
After I borrow his face,

347
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,902
you walk him out the front door
and hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

348
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,238
You're not getting rid of me
that easily, Hunt.

349
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,990
That's not what this is about.

350
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,783
Sure it is.

351
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,661
I know you don't want me
on this detail.

352
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,329
But let's face it:

353
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,248
If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,

354
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,749
I wouldn't be here.

355
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,167
And if you hadn't gunned down

356
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,336
every Syndicate agent
they sent you to find,

357
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,963
I wouldn't be here.

358
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,340
That's right, I know all about you.

359
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,427
You're why we don't have a living witness
who can identify John Lark

360
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,220
or the Apostles.

361
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,848
If you have a problem
with my methods,

362
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,891
you can always stay behind.

363
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:33,478
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

364
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,355
Isn't that the thing?

365
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,567
<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>

366
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,654
Suit up. The Widow is meeting Lark
in 30 minutes.

367
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,423
<i>Ten seconds to decompression.</i>

368
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,886
ls your oxygen on?

369
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,390
There is no atmosphere
at this altitude.

370
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,267
I don't need you
blacking out on me.

371
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,898
Hey, your heads-up display has
a built-in guidance system.

372
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,232
Follow it to the target.

373
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,026
Open your chute when the system says,

374
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,778
not before and definitely not after,

375
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,488
or the last thing that
goes through your mind

376
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,364
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

377
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,532
Crystal.

378
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,848
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

379
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,225
Out of my way, Hunt.

380
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,143
Walker, we've got a problem.
There's a storm. We need to...

381
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,229
Enough talk.

382
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,980
I'll see you in Paris.

383
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,489
Come on, come on, come on.

384
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,046
<i>Altitude: 25,000 feet.</i>

385
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,678
Walker?

386
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,056
What's the matter, Hunt?
You afraid of a little lightning?

387
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,609
<i>Altitude: 20,000 feet.</i>

388
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,278
Son of a bitch.

389
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,446
Walker?

390
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,284
Do you COPY?

391
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,036
Walker?

392
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,293
Walker?

393
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,425
Come on.

394
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,219
<i>Altitude: 15,000 feet.</i>

395
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,807
Walker.

396
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:17,893
Walker!

397
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,071
Walker!

398
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,240
Walker!

399
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,076
<i>Altitude: 10,000 feet.</i>

400
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,623
<i>9,000.</i>

401
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,999
Oh, shit.

402
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,753
<i>8,000.</i>

403
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,257
<i>7,000.</i>

404
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,179
<i>6,000.</i>

405
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,850
<i>5, 000.</i>

406
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,938
<i>4, 000.</i>

407
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,272
Walker!

408
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,774
Walker!

409
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,692
<i>3,000.</i>

410
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,195
<i>Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.</i>

00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,572
<i>Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.</i>

412
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,783
<i>Deploy. Deploy-</i>

413
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,256
Oh, God.

414
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,237
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

415
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,304
That's where the Widow is meeting Lark.

416
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,264
<i>Ethan.</i>

417
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,391
- Walker.
- Ethan, if you can hear me,

418
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,476
I've got him.

419
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,270
Say again. Where?

420
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,272
<i>He's headed for the bathroom.</i>

421
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,514
- Where's the needle?
- Didn't need it.

422
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,850
Get him up.

423
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,963
Hey, hey-

424
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,735
Don't be shy, the more the merrier.

425
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,736
Come on. we're not mean.

426
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:02,904
Can we join you?

427
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:05,114
Can we join you? We won't bite, guys.

428
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,231
Shit.

429
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,545
- Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

430
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,924
Sorry. I was aiming for his chest.

431
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,678
- What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you, too.

432
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:34,305
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
You are...

433
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,809
An old friend.

434
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,865
Cancel extraction. We're code blue.

435
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,326
Send sanitation.

436
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,495
North men's room.

437
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,333
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

438
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,380
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

439
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,424
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

440
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,591
What is it?

441
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,969
You want some. too?

442
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,973
You're not here by accident. Who sent you?

443
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,558
I can't tell you that.

444
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,642
What are you doing?

445
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:20,727
I have a date with the White Widow.

446
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,479
He had a date with the Widow.
You look nothing like him.

447
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:26,190
And now we have to hope
they never met.

448
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:29,110
- Hope is not a strategy!
- Oh, you must be new.

449
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:30,528
I have no other choice.

450
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:32,196
The White Widow's our only lead.

451
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,656
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

452
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,533
- Don't do it.
- What?

453
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,619
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

454
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,329
You don't understand
what you're involved in.

455
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,039
I don't understand
what I'm involved in.

456
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,876
I don't understand
what I'm involved in?

457
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,838
What am I involved in?

458
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,758
If you're meeting the Widow,
she leaves in three minutes.

459
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,719
- Ethan!
<i>- I'll</i> make it work.

460
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,512
- Ethan!
<i>- I'll</i> make it work.

461
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,433
The name's Walker.

462
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,643
Yeah? You're welcome.

463
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:22,955
What do you think you're doing?

464
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,582
- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.

465
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,750
People have been sent here to kill Lark.

466
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,834
No shit.

467
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,045
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

468
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,838
They don't know what he looks like,

469
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,548
they only know he's meeting
the Widow at midnight.

470
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,883
If you go through with this,

471
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,219
they're gonna believe you're Lark
and they're gonna kill you.

472
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,678
How do you know all this?

473
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,098
I can't tell you that.

474
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,728
You should've stayed out of the game.

475
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,649
You should've come with me.

476
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,577
This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

477
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:05,081
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,

478
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,084
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

479
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,004
But there was another side to her,

480
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,090
a side most people never saw.

481
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,885
It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us

482
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,762
all together tonight.

483
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,432
Max was something of a paradox.

484
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,187
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

485
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,774
a fascination she passed on to me.

486
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:37,780
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

487
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,701
But she had dreams
of a very different future.

488
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:46,205
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

489
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,542
All she earned from the way the world is

490
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:53,629
went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.

491
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,632
That future isn't here yet.

492
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:02,597
Tonight, your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.

493
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,102
Thank you all for coming.

494
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,770
Enjoy the party.

495
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,377
You can't possibly be John Lark.

496
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,549
I'm not, actually.

497
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,052
It's an alias.

498
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,806
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

499
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,141
Is there another name you prefer?

500
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,976
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

501
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,312
In fact I like "Lark."
It does have a certain ring.

502
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,438
We don't have a lot of time.

503
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,065
'Cause I'll be honest.

504
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,484
A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone

505
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,152
uglier.

506
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,656
Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.

507
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:04,492
And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.

508
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,328
Don't you touch her.

509
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,413
Relax. It's my brother.

510
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,291
You're being rude to our guest, Zola.

511
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,168
It's time to go.

512
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,671
Don't turn this into a scene.

513
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,383
You don't want to be with this one.

514
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:29,725
- You were saying?
- Your life is in danger.

515
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,519
And who would want to kill me?

516
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,062
The Americans, for starters.

517
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,730
If that were true, I would know it.

518
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,483
You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?

519
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,903
There are people here
who don't want this meeting to happen.

520
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,571
Don't believe me?

521
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,573
Look around.

522
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,212
I know what you're thinking.

523
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,673
Maybe they're not here for you.

524
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,800
Maybe they're just here for me.

525
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:05,302
Are you willing to take that chance?

526
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:08,139
You have something I want.

527
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,683
Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust

528
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,643
to get you out of here alive.

529
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,312
Or would you rather leave that
to your brother?

530
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,154
I think I'd like
to go home now, Mr. Lark.

531
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,916
The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

532
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,377
Delivery will be via air
to the Finance Ministry

533
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,587
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

534
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,173
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

535
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,175
will transport him via this route.

536
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,511
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

537
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,557
The motorcade will automatically take
the preplanned alternate route here,

538
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,226
where we'll extract the asset.

539
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,313
Extract the asset?

540
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,742
The asset.

541
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,705
We paid a great deal of money
for this information.

542
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,374
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

543
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,002
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

544
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,880
His name is Solomon Lane.

545
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,633
British Special Agent turned anarchist.

546
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,677
He used rogue covert operatives

547
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:36,055
to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.

548
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,975
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

549
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,311
As ugly as they come.

550
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,315
He was captured by American agents
two years ago.

551
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,610
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

552
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,904
passed around from
one government to another

553
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,407
to answer for his crimes.

554
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,745
You seem displeased, Lark.

555
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,415
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

556
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,752
I came to Paris for plutonium.

557
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,588
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

558
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:11,590
I'm just a broker.

559
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,759
I connect a buyer and a seller.

560
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:18,180
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

561
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,516
Extract Lane

562
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,851
and make a trade.

563
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,520
That's right.

564
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,277
How do I know the seller has what I want?

565
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:52,798
A down payment in good faith.

566
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,468
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

567
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,305
in exchange for him.

568
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,731
All right.

569
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,692
What happens after the diversion?

570
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,703
Kill everyone?

571
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,414
That's your plan?

572
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,749
There will be no witnesses.

573
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,752
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

574
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,295
He's in an armored box.

575
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,006
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

576
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,008
You want your plutonium,

577
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,261
this is the price.

578
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,723
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

579
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:09,017
That's John Lark you're talking to.

580
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,357
I murder women and children
with smallpox.

581
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,403
I have no line.

582
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,741
Right.

583
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:28,120
Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.

584
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,225
<i>You have got to be kidding me.</i>

585
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,061
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

586
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:56,231
I wanted Lark to break him out,
not Ethan Hunt.

587
00:46:56,315 --> 00:47:00,152
I wanted Lark at the exchange,
not Ethan Hunt.

588
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:03,363
I wanted Lark to lead us
to the plutonium

589
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,240
and the Apostles.

590
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:06,325
You may still get your chance.

591
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,702
Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled

592
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,162
out of the men's room at the Grand Palais?

593
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,039
I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

594
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:13,540
More likely one of Lark's recruits.

595
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:15,834
Not according to our intelligence.

596
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,128
Intelligence gathered by whom?

597
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,757
Hunt.

598
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:26,053
You've long held suspicions that Lark
was an American agent.

599
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,763
Someone who knew our every move.

600
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,057
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

601
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,102
You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark.

602
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:39,316
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

603
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,151
It won't work.

604
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:44,571
Think about it.
Would a man as careful as Lark

605
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,698
really stick his neck out like that?

606
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:48,784
For a face-to-face with the White Widow?

607
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,578
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

608
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,455
And if he was really smart,

609
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,166
he'd have his lady friend kill that decoy

610
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,168
in front of a reliable witness.

611
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,253
Me.

612
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,714
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

613
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,717
So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark

614
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,969
and has him killed.

615
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,222
And under the guise
of serving his country...

616
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:12,891
Assumes his own secret identity.

617
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,560
Free to operate at will

618
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:16,353
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

619
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,646
Why?

620
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,982
Why would Hunt turn?

621
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:23,318
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

622
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,822
They were believers in a cause.

623
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,408
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

624
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,286
they turned
against their masters.

625
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,581
How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,

626
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,416
disavowed him, cast him aside?

627
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,502
And how long before
a man like that

628
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,379
has had enough?

629
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,674
That is a serious accusation.

630
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,844
Can you prove it?

631
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,391
This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body

632
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,851
at the Grand Palais.

633
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,650
I'm guessing
it has all the proof you need.

634
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,736
Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?

635
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,239
Yes.

636
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,783
Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane

637
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:17,868
just to kill one man?

638
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:20,620
Yes.

639
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,749
- Is it true that he...
- Hey, Walker.

640
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,918
Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,

641
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:28,587
it's probably true.

642
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,094
Holy shit.

643
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:40,015
You're the guy
that caught him, aren't you?

644
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:42,934
How long do you think

645
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,519
he's gonna keep that
to himself?

646
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,817
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

647
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,384
What the hell is he doing?

648
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,685
Hunt? Where are you?

649
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,520
Don't wait for me!

650
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:40,190
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

651
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,691
I'll meet you at the garage.

652
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:52,994
Benji, do you copy?

653
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,829
We copy. Go.

654
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:58,041
<i>Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.</i>

655
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,709
We're on our way.

656
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:18,144
He's heading from Notre Dame to the
St. Louis bridge. Units are in pursuit...

657
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:40,615
<i>STOP.</i>

658
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:42,742
Stay where you are.

659
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:44,744
Get in the car.

660
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,746
Nobody move.

661
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,334
Show me your hands.

662
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,921
Walk away...

663
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:55,588
Walk away... please.

664
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:56,297
Everyone...

665
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:57,173
Everyone... show me your hands.

666
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,390
Just walk away...

667
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,516
Just walk away... please.

668
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,151
Zola wants a word with you.

669
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:22,532
What about her?

670
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:23,991
Finish her.

671
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,023
You'll be all right.

672
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,491
We got to go.

673
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,578
I'm so sorry.

674
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:09,579
Come on.

675
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,658
The name's Walker, by the way.

676
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,077
Was the little car your idea?

677
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,464
Jesus Christ!

678
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,008
What the hell was that?

679
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:12,266
- Everybody out.
- Go, go, go!

680
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:50,800
That was Ilsa.

681
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:52,843
Shut up.

682
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,929
Very interesting.

683
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:00,726
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

684
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:40,391
Oh, look who's still alive.

685
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:45,980
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

686
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,690
Got it. You know what to do.

687
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,984
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt

688
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,444
enough.

689
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:56,115
Ninety seconds.

690
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:58,075
You and your Apostles think
we're gonna trade you

691
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,869
for the missing plutonium.

692
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,580
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

693
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:06,041
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

694
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:08,878
I wonder, Ethan,

695
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:10,463
did you ever choose not to?

696
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,798
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

697
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:15,718
who it was giving you the orders or why?

698
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,514
While every day the master you serve
moves one step closer to ending the world.

699
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:23,100
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

700
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:24,310
Sixty seconds.

701
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:26,437
Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,

702
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,232
hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.

703
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:33,569
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

704
01:08:33,986 --> 01:08:36,363
In my experience,
they don't do either for very long.

705
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,532
Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories

706
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,159
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

707
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,787
Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!

708
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,956
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

709
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,958
- Luther?
- Almost there.

710
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,169
You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan.

711
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,005
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

712
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:57,218
The Syndicate was created
to tear them down, brick by brick.

713
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,303
The Syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.

714
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:03,057
The Syndicate
was civilization's last hope!

715
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,560
A chance to smash the old world order.

716
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:08,938
That hope is gone now
because of you

717
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:11,649
and your pathetic morality.

718
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,486
You should have killed me, Ethan.

719
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,074
The end you've always feared

720
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,034
is coming.

721
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,121
It's coming!

722
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,876
And the blood will be on your hands.

723
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:34,797
The fallout

724
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:38,551
of all your good intentions.

725
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:46,767
- Time.
- Got it.

726
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:12,710
Get him up.

727
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:16,881
You're mine now.

728
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,183
You're just full of surprises, Lark.

729
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,603
Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.

730
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,855
You'd have lost all your men

731
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,648
and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.

732
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,067
I had to improvise.

733
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,195
Well, why not say that in the first place?

734
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,072
Because I don't trust your people.

735
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,450
Especially not your brother.

736
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:51,040
Family. What can you do?

737
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,003
So, where's Lane?

738
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,339
Certainly not at the bottom
of the Seine.

739
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,174
I have him. He's safe.

740
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,676
Where do I meet the courier?

741
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,638
Let's talk about the woman.

742
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:09,141
Woman?

743
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,684
She was with you at the Palais.

744
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:12,144
Zola saw her again today.

745
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:13,979
She tried to kill Lane.

746
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:16,148
She had the chance to kill you,
but she didn't.

747
01:11:16,565 --> 01:11:17,566
Why?

748
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,155
We have a past.

749
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,824
It's complicated.

750
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:30,287
Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.

751
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:32,790
My price just went up.

752
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:35,042
Someone killed four of my men today.

753
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,710
I'm assuming it was her.

754
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,969
I want her, Lark.

755
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:47,554
And you're gonna bring her to me.

756
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,432
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

757
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:52,893
and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.

758
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:56,605
I'd hate for her
to come between us.

759
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,152
She's yours.

760
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,489
At the meeting. Not before.

761
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,294
Go to London.

762
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:22,214
Instructions will follow.

763
01:14:03,732 --> 01:14:06,610
I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.

764
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:08,237
Are you okay?

765
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:11,865
Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you.

766
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,034
I know you have your reasons.

767
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:15,744
I know.

768
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:21,542
You need to walk away.

769
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,960
I can't do that.

770
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,214
You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark.

771
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,423
No.

772
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:31,802
You were there to protect him.

773
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:33,512
Yes.

774
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:35,389
And you killed him to protect me.

775
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:40,144
You wanted Lark to break Lane out.

776
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:45,023
No. You needed him to break Lane out.

777
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,943
Because you have to kill Lane.

778
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,280
Who's making you do this?

779
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:54,491
MI6.

780
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,120
Why?

781
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,205
After we captured him in London,

782
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:03,584
they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.

783
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:06,336
But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.

784
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,338
A man like that, what he's seen,

785
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:09,923
what he knows about British Intelligence,

786
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,385
they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.

787
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:15,137
That's not what I'm asking.

788
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:17,431
Why did they send you?

789
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:20,934
This is how I prove my loyalty.

790
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,145
This is how I come home.

791
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:25,022
But you were out.

792
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:26,523
You were free.

793
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,358
We are never free.

794
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,987
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

795
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,781
To them, I'm as much of a threat as he is.

796
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:39,328
I kill him, or I never stop running.

797
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:44,041
Now tell me where he is.

798
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,547
I can't help you.

799
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:53,342
I will get to him one way or another.

800
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:56,929
Please don't make me go through you.

801
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,111
Yes.

802
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:55,988
<i>Are you here in London?</i>

803
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:57,364
<i>lam.</i>

804
01:16:57,447 --> 01:16:59,449
Are you ready to meet the courier?

805
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:02,286
<i>Yes. Where do I go?</i>

806
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:04,329
Where would you like to meet?

807
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:43,493
Mr. Secretary.

808
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:46,747
I prayed to God that it wasn't true.

809
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,415
Well, in his defense, sir,

810
01:17:48,498 --> 01:17:49,958
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

811
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,376
a great many people
would have been killed.

812
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,712
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

813
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:56,965
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

814
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,760
So what the hell happened?

815
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:21,698
...at which point, we were
told to come to London

816
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:23,658
and await further instructions.

817
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:25,243
And what happens now?

818
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:27,120
Now,

819
01:18:28,163 --> 01:18:29,748
we meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

820
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:31,333
She'll take us to a courier

821
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,503
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

822
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,171
Or, in our scenario,

823
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:38,632
Benji.

824
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:40,175
Jesus.

825
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,593
I'm sorry, what?

826
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,220
Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

827
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:44,971
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

828
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:46,139
Absolutely not.

829
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,516
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

830
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:48,600
Benji.

831
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,520
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

832
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,688
and I will do so at any cost.

833
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,440
Even if I have to trade Lane.

834
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,942
The real Lane.

835
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:59,069
And I will never let him go.

836
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:02,155
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games,

837
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,533
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

838
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:06,618
You let us worry about the Apostles.

839
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:09,121
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

840
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:10,664
A bigger problem?

841
01:19:11,415 --> 01:19:12,916
- Ilsa.
- Ilsa?

842
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,543
Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?

843
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:15,752
How is she mixed up in all of this?

844
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:18,171
She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

845
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:21,675
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

846
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:22,801
Yeah.

847
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,094
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

848
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,387
- No, not us. Not us.
- Yeah.

849
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,722
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

850
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:28,849
And she will kill me!

851
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,058
I'm not gonna let that happen.

852
01:19:30,142 --> 01:19:32,102
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

853
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,939
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

854
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:37,399
Right now, we don't have a lot of time.

855
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:38,942
We have to get ready for this meeting.

856
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,485
The meeting is a trap.

857
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,780
The White Widow is working with the CIA.

858
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:45,407
She has been since the beginning.

859
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:49,327
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

860
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:51,955
Capturing the plutonium,
and the Apostles, and John Lark

861
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,499
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

862
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:57,461
But if Sloane knew the meeting was a trap,
why didn't she just tell us?

863
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:59,588
Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,

864
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:01,423
including one of us.

865
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,676
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

866
01:20:07,179 --> 01:20:08,597
According to that dossier,

867
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,141
a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt

868
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:14,394
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

869
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:16,855
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

870
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,982
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.

871
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:21,401
And, of course,
Hunt handed over the plutonium

872
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:23,320
to the Apostles himself.

873
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:25,363
Now, those facts, coupled with

874
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:28,158
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

875
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,785
corroborate a CIA narrative

876
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,663
that Hunt has snapped.

877
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,291
And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover

878
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:38,210
to hide the fact that Lark...

879
01:20:39,294 --> 01:20:40,295
...is me.

880
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,758
I've got to hand it to you, Ethan.

881
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,177
Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,

882
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,845
it's just a figure of speech.

883
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:56,520
I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.

884
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,689
The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

885
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,234
And where did Sloane get this information?

886
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:04,778
She didn't say.

887
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:07,948
She did, however,
grant me the opportunity to bring you in,

888
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,200
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

889
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:12,661
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

890
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:14,871
- Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunt

891
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:17,499
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

892
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:18,959
That's why we're taking him back.

893
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:22,170
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

894
01:21:22,254 --> 01:21:23,380
- Ethan...
- Sir, what do you

895
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:24,631
think this is? A coincidence?

896
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:25,757
That someone just happened upon this?

897
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,468
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

898
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:30,428
Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.

899
01:21:30,512 --> 01:21:31,513
Don't you see?

900
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:33,348
This, sir...

901
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,433
This is the trap.

902
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,394
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

903
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:40,063
There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!

904
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,440
And you lost them!

905
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,903
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

906
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:50,115
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

907
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,701
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

908
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:57,205
Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

909
01:21:57,622 --> 01:22:00,458
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

910
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,295
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

911
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:05,213
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

912
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:07,632
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

913
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:09,926
or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

914
01:22:11,428 --> 01:22:12,762
And if I refuse?

915
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,015
What do you think he's here for?

916
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,349
You think he's some observer?

917
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:17,892
He's an assassin!

918
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,520
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

919
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:23,607
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down

920
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:25,442
and kill you.

921
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,281
Ifsthejob.
No hard feelings.

922
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,241
Accept it, Ethan.

923
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:35,493
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

924
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:39,414
No, sir. No.

925
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:42,626
I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.

926
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,337
This mission is terminated.

927
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:47,172
Now!

928
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:51,384
Stickell, he's your friend.

929
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:52,761
Would you please talk
some sense into...

930
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,516
I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.

931
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:02,604
There's 15 minutes
before we meet the Widow.

932
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,272
You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

933
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,316
who can get it for you. You in or out?

934
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:09,277
In.

935
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:11,696
- What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

936
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,657
- No, Ethan...
- There's no time, Luther.

937
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,408
I need you to trust me.

938
01:23:32,384 --> 01:23:33,718
You all right?

939
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,387
Yeah, I just

940
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:37,722
got a bad feeling about this one.

941
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:05,291
If you don't hear from us...

942
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,377
I'll do it my way.

943
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,133
Don't take your eyes off him.

944
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,588
Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.

945
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,006
Where's Hunt?

946
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:55,675
He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.

947
01:24:55,759 --> 01:24:56,885
Calm down.

948
01:24:56,968 --> 01:24:58,636
Call the Apostles. Warn them.

949
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,513
I have no way of contacting them.

950
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,223
For their safety and mine.

951
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:03,933
What I do have is an extraction team with

952
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:06,269
satellite overvvatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.

953
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:07,771
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.

954
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:10,190
No, I'm staying here.

955
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,150
I haven't finished with Hunt yet.

956
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:19,699
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?

957
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,076
I don't understand what you mean.

958
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,870
The deal was simple.

959
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:27,165
I help you frame Hunt,
you give me the plutonium.

960
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:29,083
You're wasting time.

961
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:32,212
"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.

962
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:35,298
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

963
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:36,758
When I wrote those words,

964
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:41,095
I wasn't referring to your peace
or Hunt's suffering.

965
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:43,306
The old world order
needs dismantling,

966
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:45,350
and we have the tools
to dismantle it.

967
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:47,018
All you seem to care about

968
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:49,771
is that Hunt lives to take the blame.

969
01:25:49,854 --> 01:25:51,523
That's not anarchy.

970
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:53,149
That's revenge.

971
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:54,776
Yes, it is.

972
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:56,945
And when I have what I want,

973
01:25:57,821 --> 01:26:00,240
the Apostles will give you the plutonium.

974
01:26:04,244 --> 01:26:05,829
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

975
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:06,955
You're only alive today

976
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:09,040
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.

977
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:11,835
Sloane was right.
The IMF is Halloween.

978
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:14,170
Nothing but grown men
wearing...

979
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:22,887
What?

980
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,437
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

981
01:26:35,567 --> 01:26:37,569
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

982
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:43,867
And you were doing so well
up until then.

983
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:46,119
Now, I think this one's loaded.

984
01:26:46,578 --> 01:26:48,329
You want to find out?

985
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:33,124
- So, how'd I do?
- I never had a doubt.

986
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:37,337
I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.

987
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,172
Hats off, Mr. Secretary.

988
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,883
- The man's a natural.
- Welcome to the team, sir.

989
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,886
You're making a mistake.

990
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:49,307
No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.

991
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,976
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,

992
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,145
just like you are, trying to
recover that plutonium.

993
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:56,773
That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier

994
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:58,107
and tried to frame Hunt.

995
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,734
He makes a good point,

996
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:01,069
Lark.

997
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,738
He's paranoid. Delusional.

998
01:28:04,072 --> 01:28:05,740
Just like the dossier says.

999
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:07,533
So where did Sloane get the dossier from?

1000
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,619
I have no idea.

1001
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,079
<i>I</i> do.

1002
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:15,541
Did you get all that, Erika?

1003
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,001
<i>I did.</i>

1004
01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:19,587
<i>I don't appreciate being used, Walker.</i>

1005
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:23,424
Bad boy.

1006
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:25,635
Where would you like him delivered?

1007
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:27,971
I'll come to you.

1008
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:32,475
Nobody move! Nobody move!

1009
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,102
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1010
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:36,938
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

1011
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:39,107
Drop it! Drop it!

1012
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:40,733
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1013
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:43,361
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

1014
01:28:44,278 --> 01:28:45,405
I thought we had a deal.

1015
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:48,324
<i>We did. And now we don't.</i>

1016
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:51,995
<i>There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.</i>

1017
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:54,956
I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.

1018
01:28:55,123 --> 01:28:56,624
The plutonium is still out there!

1019
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,502
And I don't trust a living soul
in that room to get it.

1020
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:02,505
<i>We'll sort out who's who in Washington.</i>

1021
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:04,882
- Erika!
- Sir?

1022
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:07,468
It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.

1023
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,264
The only real threats are in this room,
and we have them.

1024
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,935
Do you?

1025
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,021
Go.

1026
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,250
Where the hell is Lane?

1027
01:30:09,906 --> 01:30:10,907
Ethan! Ethan!

1028
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:37,475
First team is down.
Send backup.

1029
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,562
Sir!

1030
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:45,024
Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!

1031
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:48,903
Somebody help!

1032
01:30:57,912 --> 01:30:59,080
Sir.

1033
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:06,087
Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.

1034
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,588
You got to get him.

1035
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:13,594
Go.

1036
01:31:15,138 --> 01:31:16,722
I'm sorry, sir.

1037
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:19,851
Go.

1038
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:31,779
Ethan?

1039
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:37,076
Wait!

1040
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:40,288
Get that son of a bitch.

1041
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:10,943
Come on, come on, come on.

1042
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:12,320
Yes! I got him.

1043
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:24,790
I'm sorry.

1044
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,835
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1045
01:32:27,919 --> 01:32:29,962
<i>He's about a quarter mile west
if you turn right.</i>

1046
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,631
To my right?

1047
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:35,885
I can't do that.

1048
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:37,470
<i>Why not?</i>

1049
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:39,639
Because I'm being followed.

1050
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,807
<i>What do you mean? By who?</i>

1051
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:43,559
How do I know?
CIA, Apostles...

1052
01:32:43,643 --> 01:32:44,977
What difference does it make?

1053
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:48,814
<i>Okay, okay, just get out of there
and then go right.</i>

1054
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,949
I am terribly sorry.

1055
01:32:58,282 --> 01:32:59,617
Excuse me.

1056
01:33:16,634 --> 01:33:18,177
Why is he running in circles?

1057
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:47,581
Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

1058
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:54,797
<i>Ethan, did you copy?</i>

1059
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,174
<i>- Left, go left, now!
- I'm working on it.</i>

1060
01:34:08,519 --> 01:34:10,688
<i>Now go across the street
right in front of you.</i>

1061
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,865
<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.</i>

1062
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:54,273
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

1063
01:34:56,734 --> 01:34:58,402
Straight? Keep going straight?

1064
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:00,738
<i>Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.</i>

1065
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:03,699
<i>Okay, now turn right.</i>

1066
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:04,950
Right?

1067
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:06,535
Now?

1068
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:08,329
<i>- Yes, right!
Are you sure'?</i>

1069
01:35:08,496 --> 01:35:09,663
Yes, I'm...

1070
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:11,791
No, it's left! Turn left!

1071
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:13,751
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1072
01:35:17,588 --> 01:35:18,923
Left.

1073
01:35:22,385 --> 01:35:23,636
Thank you.

1074
01:35:30,267 --> 01:35:33,270
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm jumping out a window!

1075
01:35:33,354 --> 01:35:35,147
What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...

1076
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,068
Oh, sorry. I had it in 2D.

1077
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,778
Good luck.

1078
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:16,897
At the end of the bridge,
turn left. You've almost got him.

1079
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:23,112
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!

1080
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:24,196
You're right on top of him!

1081
01:36:39,253 --> 01:36:40,504
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1082
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:41,714
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1083
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:21,378
You can't do it, can you?
Not until you get your plutonium.

1084
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:25,549
No. He still has plans for you.

1085
01:37:26,634 --> 01:37:29,720
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John Lark,

1086
01:37:30,054 --> 01:37:33,140
then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

1087
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:34,767
And if I don't?

1088
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:49,365
I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.

1089
01:37:50,991 --> 01:37:53,911
If I see you again, she dies.

1090
01:37:53,994 --> 01:37:56,622
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1091
01:37:56,997 --> 01:37:58,290
Know when you're beat.

1092
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,699
These are the designs we recovered
from Dr. Delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1093
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:15,868
That's a five-megaton nuclear device.

1094
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:17,578
That's greater than
all the explosive energy

1095
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:18,704
released in World War ll.

1096
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:22,458
To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1097
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:24,001
What, "normally"?

1098
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:26,920
Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,

1099
01:39:27,004 --> 01:39:28,380
meaning two bombs.

1100
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:31,008
Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe

1101
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:32,885
which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.

1102
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:37,139
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

1103
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:40,267
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1104
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:43,020
The countdown is
started by a remote detonator,

1105
01:39:43,103 --> 01:39:45,105
which is also a fail-safe.

1106
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:47,483
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1107
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,485
it can't be stopped.

1108
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:53,656
So the solution to this is?

1109
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:57,159
We're working on it.

1110
01:39:58,744 --> 01:39:59,745
So,

1111
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:02,831
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1112
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:14,927
What is it?

1113
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:17,846
Have a seat. Please.

1114
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,852
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1115
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:26,855
he's only been serious
about two women.

1116
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,692
One was his wife.

1117
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:31,777
He's married?

1118
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,987
No, he was.

1119
01:40:34,363 --> 01:40:36,115
Was? What happened to her?

1120
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:37,825
Well, she was taken

1121
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,869
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1122
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,747
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1123
01:40:44,373 --> 01:40:45,916
Then he quit the game.

1124
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:49,086
They were happy for a while.

1125
01:40:49,545 --> 01:40:52,506
But every time something bad
happened in the world,

1126
01:40:52,673 --> 01:40:55,092
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1127
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:57,928
And she would wonder,
"Who's watching the world

1128
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:00,013
"while Ethan's watching me?"

1129
01:41:00,431 --> 01:41:03,600
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1130
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:06,770
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1131
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:10,441
all because
they were together.

1132
01:41:11,525 --> 01:41:12,609
So...

1133
01:41:14,987 --> 01:41:17,740
- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.

1134
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:19,283
Good at it, too.

1135
01:41:19,533 --> 01:41:21,201
Taught her myself.

1136
01:41:21,535 --> 01:41:23,912
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1137
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:25,122
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1138
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:27,833
And that keeps him going.

1139
01:41:29,168 --> 01:41:30,669
Why are you telling me this?

1140
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:38,177
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1141
01:41:40,763 --> 01:41:42,139
He's a good man.

1142
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:46,477
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1143
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:51,273
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1144
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:55,944
If you care about him,

1145
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,030
you should walk away.

1146
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:02,910
Luther...

1147
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:04,495
ls everything all right?

1148
01:42:16,757 --> 01:42:18,467
I'm coming with you.

1149
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:28,560
I know.

1150
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,066
So how do we find him?

1151
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,444
Microwave transponder.

1152
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:40,322
Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.

1153
01:42:40,656 --> 01:42:42,324
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

1154
01:42:43,492 --> 01:42:44,618
We removed it in Paris.

1155
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:47,037
At the same time,
we put our own transponder in.

1156
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:48,288
Got it.

1157
01:42:50,249 --> 01:42:52,501
36-hour delayed activation,

1158
01:42:52,668 --> 01:42:55,087
in case Lane's Apostles scan him.

1159
01:42:55,838 --> 01:42:57,840
So you planned on letting him go.

1160
01:42:58,006 --> 01:43:00,092
Not this way, but yes.

1161
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,885
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1162
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:03,762
How can you be sure?

1163
01:43:03,929 --> 01:43:06,014
His plan to put me in prison went to hell.

1164
01:43:07,182 --> 01:43:09,351
Now he's gonna want me there
for the end.

1165
01:43:09,852 --> 01:43:11,436
So when does this transponder activate?

1166
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,980
I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!

1167
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:15,232
He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.

1168
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:16,400
He's airborne.

1169
01:43:16,567 --> 01:43:17,693
Shall we inform the CIA?

1170
01:43:18,277 --> 01:43:19,695
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1171
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:22,281
I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.

1172
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:24,449
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1173
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:28,328
So where do we go?

1174
01:43:48,724 --> 01:43:50,058
How we doing, Benji?

1175
01:43:50,517 --> 01:43:53,186
If there's a way to defuse these bombs,
I can't find it.

1176
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:55,606
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

1177
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,526
Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1178
01:43:59,902 --> 01:44:01,528
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1179
01:44:01,904 --> 01:44:05,240
- What's his last position?
- About 30 miles northeast.

1180
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:07,492
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1181
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:09,494
- What's there?
- The Nubra River Valley.

1182
01:44:09,661 --> 01:44:11,371
There's only a medical camp there.

1183
01:44:11,455 --> 01:44:13,832
Humanitarian Aid Overseas.

1184
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:16,919
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1185
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:18,545
Smallpox.

1186
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:20,213
What?

1187
01:44:20,297 --> 01:44:23,550
Smallpox. The Apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

1188
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:26,678
Lane must've wanted that camp there
for a reason.

1189
01:44:26,929 --> 01:44:28,263
But what?

1190
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:30,891
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

1191
01:44:31,725 --> 01:44:34,811
The Nubra River is at the base
of the Siachen Glacier.

1192
01:44:35,145 --> 01:44:36,647
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

1193
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:39,816
the largest natural irrigation system
in the world.

1194
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:44,154
Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.

1195
01:44:45,781 --> 01:44:48,283
They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.

1196
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,660
"The greater the suffering..."

1197
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:51,912
"...the greater the peace."

1198
01:44:52,454 --> 01:44:55,290
I still don't understand
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1199
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:56,625
It doesn't matter.

1200
01:44:56,792 --> 01:44:59,378
All that matters now is we find a way
to defuse those bombs.

1201
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:01,213
I think I've found it.

1202
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:03,048
Maybe.

1203
01:45:03,131 --> 01:45:05,550
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1204
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,970
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1205
01:45:08,136 --> 01:45:10,472
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1206
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:12,975
the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.

1207
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:14,601
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1208
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:15,686
and remove that key.

1209
01:45:15,769 --> 01:45:16,812
Yeah.

1210
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:19,731
While the rest of us cut the fuses
on both bombs. Simple.

1211
01:45:20,565 --> 01:45:21,858
Yeah, but...

1212
01:45:22,234 --> 01:45:23,568
But what?

1213
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:26,029
Well, in order to make this work,

1214
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:28,240
we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses

1215
01:45:28,407 --> 01:45:31,076
until after the countdown starts.

1216
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,412
But wait, just so I've got this clear.

1217
01:45:33,578 --> 01:45:36,081
Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs

1218
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:38,041
is to let the countdown start.

1219
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:41,503
And then remove that key.

1220
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:50,929
Okay.

1221
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:12,325
Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

1222
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:15,370
Fifteen minutes should
give you enough time

1223
01:46:15,454 --> 01:46:17,539
to reach minimum safe distance.

1224
01:46:19,958 --> 01:46:22,127
My running days are over.

1225
01:46:23,045 --> 01:46:25,297
This is where it ends for me.

1226
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:56,036
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1227
01:46:56,203 --> 01:46:59,581
We're at a medical camp.
X-ray machines, CAT scanners,

1228
01:46:59,664 --> 01:47:01,041
radiological signatures everywhere.

1229
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:02,709
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1230
01:47:02,793 --> 01:47:04,753
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1231
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:06,630
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1232
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:18,016
Ethan?

1233
01:47:23,855 --> 01:47:24,940
Julia?

1234
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,113
Is that...

1235
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:36,451
Julia!

1236
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,704
Does he know?

1237
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:41,873
Hey.

1238
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:44,668
This is my husband, Erik.

1239
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:46,086
This is...

1240
01:47:46,169 --> 01:47:47,838
Rob. Rob Thorne.
Dr. Rob Thorne.

1241
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:50,590
- I worked with Julia...
- At Mass General.

1242
01:47:51,341 --> 01:47:52,342
Before New York.

1243
01:47:52,425 --> 01:47:53,760
Oh, you're kidding.

1244
01:47:53,927 --> 01:47:55,679
- What a coincidence!
- I know. I...

1245
01:47:55,846 --> 01:47:57,681
- What brings you all this way?
- I was...

1246
01:47:57,848 --> 01:47:59,766
I was in Turtuk, not far from here

1247
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:02,519
and heard help was needed.

1248
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:03,770
Oh, Well,

1249
01:48:03,937 --> 01:48:05,897
actually we're just about finished here.

1250
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:08,441
The whole village is inoculated. But...

1251
01:48:09,025 --> 01:48:10,777
What were you doing out in Turtuk?

1252
01:48:11,444 --> 01:48:12,946
Rob's on vacation.

1253
01:48:13,113 --> 01:48:15,782
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1254
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,828
You're a long way from home.

1255
01:48:20,078 --> 01:48:22,205
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to our guardian angel.

1256
01:48:22,998 --> 01:48:23,999
Guardian?

1257
01:48:24,249 --> 01:48:25,834
Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital

1258
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:28,003
outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.

1259
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,212
And here comes this phone call

1260
01:48:29,296 --> 01:48:30,964
from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.

1261
01:48:31,756 --> 01:48:33,175
And he says he's ready to underwrite

1262
01:48:33,258 --> 01:48:35,760
the entire operation. One condition.

1263
01:48:36,219 --> 01:48:37,721
We run the whole thing.

1264
01:48:37,929 --> 01:48:39,764
Can you believe that?

1265
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:42,434
I certainly can.

1266
01:48:42,851 --> 01:48:44,352
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1267
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:45,937
Out of the blue.

1268
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,941
That's quite a full life.

1269
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:52,110
Yeah, you know, before Julia,
I never traveled.

1270
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,029
<i>I never even left New York.</i>

1271
01:48:54,196 --> 01:48:55,822
<i>Never left the hospital.</i>

1272
01:48:55,906 --> 01:48:58,450
<i>Seven days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.</i>

1273
01:48:58,617 --> 01:49:00,118
Ethan, I think I found something.

1274
01:49:00,202 --> 01:49:02,162
I was on the fast track to be
Chief of Surgery at 50.

1275
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:03,538
Heart attack at 55.

1276
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:06,625
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1277
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:08,960
Help where it's needed most.

1278
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:11,171
So we've been on the go ever since,

1279
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:13,298
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1280
01:49:14,466 --> 01:49:16,134
I'm happy for you.

1281
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:18,386
<i>Thank you.</i>

1282
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:22,098
Well, we should get going.

1283
01:49:22,182 --> 01:49:23,558
We have a lot of
packing to do.

1284
01:49:23,642 --> 01:49:25,727
Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1285
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:27,479
Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.

1286
01:49:27,646 --> 01:49:29,648
Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1287
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:32,025
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1288
01:49:34,277 --> 01:49:36,613
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1289
01:49:36,905 --> 01:49:38,823
and why don't we give you
a ride back to Turtuk,

1290
01:49:38,907 --> 01:49:41,409
you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?

1291
01:49:41,868 --> 01:49:43,370
You're very kind.

1292
01:49:44,287 --> 01:49:46,623
Settled. See you soon.

1293
01:49:48,166 --> 01:49:49,668
It was good to see you.

1294
01:49:50,961 --> 01:49:53,797
I am so sorry, Julia. I'm so sorry.

1295
01:50:15,068 --> 01:50:16,987
Take both helicopters.

1296
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:19,823
No one else leaves.

1297
01:50:27,914 --> 01:50:29,582
Careful, careful, careful.

1298
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:35,338
It's armed.

1299
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:36,798
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1300
01:50:36,965 --> 01:50:38,675
The network signal's strong,
which means the other device

1301
01:50:38,758 --> 01:50:40,302
is close by and the detonator.

1302
01:50:40,468 --> 01:50:42,804
About half a K in that direction.

1303
01:50:44,014 --> 01:50:45,432
They're still here.

1304
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:48,101
Luther, you keep working on it.

1305
01:50:48,184 --> 01:50:49,311
You two, come with me.

1306
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:53,273
Oh, sure. I got this.

1307
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:55,692
Don't worry about old Luther.

1308
01:51:29,726 --> 01:51:31,061
Walker.

1309
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:37,734
Damn.

1310
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:39,277
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1311
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:40,445
<i>We have 15 minutes.</i>

1312
01:51:40,612 --> 01:51:42,280
Walker has the detonator.

1313
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,166
Come on, come on!

1314
01:51:55,377 --> 01:51:56,795
We have to evacuate these people.

1315
01:51:56,878 --> 01:51:57,879
There's no time.

1316
01:51:58,046 --> 01:52:00,298
This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.

1317
01:52:04,302 --> 01:52:05,428
It's too late!

1318
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:06,721
No.

1319
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:08,306
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1320
01:52:08,681 --> 01:52:10,517
- What? How?
<i>- I'll</i> figure it out.

1321
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,561
Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!

1322
01:52:14,813 --> 01:52:17,148
- What the hell is he doing?
- I find it best not to look.

1323
01:52:52,725 --> 01:52:53,810
How we doing, Luther?

1324
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:55,812
Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.

1325
01:52:55,895 --> 01:52:57,021
<i>Just make it happen.</i>

1326
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:58,231
<i>Where's Ethan?</i>

1327
01:52:58,314 --> 01:52:59,858
He's gone after the detonator.

1328
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:01,359
<i>Wait, where's the detonator?</i>

1329
01:53:39,314 --> 01:53:40,523
Luther.

1330
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:43,276
Julia. You shouldn't be here.

1331
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:44,527
Oh, my God.

1332
01:53:45,195 --> 01:53:46,446
Oh, my God.

1333
01:53:46,863 --> 01:53:47,989
IS that what I think it is?

1334
01:53:48,072 --> 01:53:49,616
<i>Luther, get her out of there!</i>

1335
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,618
Where is she gonna go?

1336
01:53:53,286 --> 01:53:54,621
What can I do?

1337
01:53:56,789 --> 01:53:58,791
In the kit,
the pliers with the red grip.

1338
01:53:58,958 --> 01:54:01,503
- Are you insane?
- Mind your business, Benji.

1339
01:54:01,669 --> 01:54:03,421
This is my business!

1340
01:55:45,982 --> 01:55:47,483
<i>Benji, do you com'?</i>

1341
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:49,402
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1342
01:55:49,736 --> 01:55:51,029
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1343
01:55:51,112 --> 01:55:52,155
<i>Hold on.</i>

1344
01:55:52,614 --> 01:55:53,865
How did you get in the helicopter?

1345
01:55:53,948 --> 01:55:55,199
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1346
01:55:55,408 --> 01:55:56,659
Did you say helicopter?

1347
01:55:56,743 --> 01:55:58,911
What the hell are you doing
in a helicopter?

1348
01:55:59,078 --> 01:56:01,664
Just... Hey, hey...
Did you find the other bomb?

1349
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:03,541
We're still looking,
but finding the bomb

1350
01:56:03,625 --> 01:56:05,418
is not gonna matter
unless we have the detonator.

1351
01:56:05,585 --> 01:56:07,462
I know. I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1352
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:09,839
<i>If he's in another helicopter,</i>

1353
01:56:10,506 --> 01:56:12,675
-how are you gonna get it?
<i>- I</i> 'll <i>figure it</i> out.

1354
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:14,594
You find the bomb,
I'll get the detonator.

1355
01:56:14,677 --> 01:56:16,012
I won't let you down.

1356
01:56:17,305 --> 01:56:18,640
I won't let you down.

1357
01:56:19,098 --> 01:56:21,517
- Be ready.
- Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1358
01:56:21,851 --> 01:56:23,770
Ethan, come in!

1359
01:56:24,145 --> 01:56:26,314
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1360
01:56:27,273 --> 01:56:28,608
Anybody?

1361
01:56:30,068 --> 01:56:31,402
I can do this. I can do this.

1362
01:56:32,028 --> 01:56:33,112
What do we got here?

1363
01:56:33,196 --> 01:56:34,280
We've got airspeed.

1364
01:56:35,114 --> 01:56:36,449
Airspeed.

1365
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:38,785
Okay, power. This is power.

1366
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,378
Payload. How do I get rid
of this payload?

1367
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:58,137
Power.

1368
01:57:12,485 --> 01:57:13,736
Wire strippers.

1369
01:57:13,903 --> 01:57:15,446
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1370
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:17,073
Sorry, the thing
with the green grip.

1371
01:57:17,615 --> 01:57:19,283
- Got it.
- The wire in my left hand.

1372
01:57:19,659 --> 01:57:21,494
- The black one?
- My left hand.

1373
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:23,996
- That's your left hand.
- Sorry, the other wire.

1374
01:57:24,163 --> 01:57:25,206
The red one?

1375
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:26,457
Yes, the red one in my right hand.

1376
01:57:26,624 --> 01:57:27,792
Just checking.

1377
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:29,544
Oh, I like her.

1378
01:57:42,682 --> 01:57:44,016
Hold this for me, will you?

1379
01:57:46,769 --> 01:57:47,770
Holy shit!

1380
01:57:52,692 --> 01:57:53,693
Damn it!

1381
01:57:55,027 --> 01:57:56,446
Get up there!

1382
01:58:04,787 --> 01:58:06,122
That's right,

1383
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:07,540
prick.

1384
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,633
Oh, shit!

1385
01:58:24,515 --> 01:58:25,516
Son of a bitch.

1386
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:29,604
All right.

1387
01:58:38,404 --> 01:58:39,781
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1388
01:58:40,698 --> 01:58:42,033
Oh, shit!

1389
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:44,494
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1390
01:58:45,495 --> 01:58:48,915
<i>Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.</i>

1391
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:51,083
<i>- Pull up.</i>
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

1392
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:53,085
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

1393
01:59:10,937 --> 01:59:12,313
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1394
01:59:12,396 --> 01:59:14,106
I think we're looking in the wrong place.

1395
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,733
Signatures everywhere.

1396
01:59:15,817 --> 01:59:17,109
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1397
01:59:17,276 --> 01:59:20,279
That's the point. I know Lane.
If we're looking here,

1398
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,282
it's because he wants us to.

1399
01:59:25,743 --> 01:59:27,078
I'm heading to the village.

1400
01:59:27,245 --> 01:59:28,996
Just wait for me, all right?

1401
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:34,126
Ilsa, I think I've found something.

1402
01:59:38,297 --> 01:59:40,633
Cut this wire right here.

1403
01:59:41,884 --> 01:59:45,096
Turn that screw counterclockwise,
very slowly.

1404
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:46,180
Got it.

1405
01:59:48,891 --> 01:59:49,976
So...

1406
01:59:51,978 --> 01:59:53,312
How is he?

1407
01:59:53,479 --> 01:59:55,940
Oh, you know. Same old Ethan.

1408
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:06,200
Jesus!

1409
02:00:10,288 --> 02:00:11,664
Oh, shit!

1410
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:13,457
No,no,no,no,no,no.

1411
02:00:21,883 --> 02:00:24,468
- Benji, I see Lane.
- What? Where?

1412
02:00:24,635 --> 02:00:26,262
<i>He's in a house
at the edge of the village.</i>

1413
02:00:26,345 --> 02:00:27,972
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1414
02:00:28,306 --> 02:00:29,640
<i>Ilsa, wait for me!</i>

1415
02:00:39,859 --> 02:00:41,110
No.

1416
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,241
Nuclear bomb.

1417
02:00:58,419 --> 02:00:59,420
Damn it!

1418
02:01:42,755 --> 02:01:44,590
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1419
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:46,467
Ilsa, where are you?

1420
02:01:46,634 --> 02:01:47,969
I'm in a house...

1421
02:02:10,616 --> 02:02:12,785
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1422
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:14,704
You're out of your mind!

1423
02:02:14,787 --> 02:02:16,372
I don't know what's down there.

1424
02:02:20,668 --> 02:02:22,294
Pull up, pull up!

1425
02:02:31,804 --> 02:02:34,140
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us!

1426
02:02:34,306 --> 02:02:35,641
Go!

1427
02:02:52,825 --> 02:02:53,826
Shit!

1428
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:55,661
Benji, come in.

1429
02:02:55,828 --> 02:02:56,996
We're almost at the fuse.

1430
02:02:57,079 --> 02:02:58,664
We need to find
that other bomb now.

1431
02:03:00,374 --> 02:03:02,376
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1432
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:05,129
- Benji, do you read me?
- I'm working on it!

1433
02:03:05,463 --> 02:03:07,048
Ilsa, where are you?

1434
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:27,026
You can't stop it.

1435
02:03:27,485 --> 02:03:30,362
Do you understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1436
02:03:30,696 --> 02:03:31,906
When the clock runs out,

1437
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:33,741
Ethan Hunt will lose everything

1438
02:03:34,909 --> 02:03:36,327
and everyone

1439
02:03:37,495 --> 02:03:39,330
he ever cared about.

1440
02:03:40,623 --> 02:03:41,999
Ilsa!

1441
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:43,084
Benji!

1442
02:03:43,209 --> 02:03:44,293
Benji!

1443
02:03:44,376 --> 02:03:46,128
Ilsa, where are you?

1444
02:03:47,463 --> 02:03:49,131
You don't want to see this.

1445
02:03:50,883 --> 02:03:52,051
Benji!

1446
02:03:52,218 --> 02:03:53,969
- Ilsa!
- Benji!

1447
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:56,263
Benji! Benji, stop!

1448
02:04:25,584 --> 02:04:26,710
Benji!

1449
02:04:51,986 --> 02:04:55,156
Oh, no, no, no!

1450
02:05:33,652 --> 02:05:34,987
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1451
02:05:38,449 --> 02:05:39,617
No, no.
Not when I'm this close.

1452
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,577
Not when I'm this close.
Come on, come on!

1453
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,101
Thank you.

1454
02:07:29,393 --> 02:07:30,728
Tie him up.

1455
02:08:34,166 --> 02:08:36,293
Why won't you just die?

1456
02:08:58,607 --> 02:09:00,609
There's nothing else you can do.

1457
02:09:02,277 --> 02:09:04,196
Go be with your husband.

1458
02:09:05,447 --> 02:09:06,782
Luther...

1459
02:09:07,282 --> 02:09:08,367
Go.

1460
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:22,631
Benji, where are you?

1461
02:09:23,215 --> 02:09:24,883
Okay, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1462
02:09:25,134 --> 02:09:27,553
<i>You should see the red wire
attached to the motherboard.</i>

1463
02:09:27,636 --> 02:09:28,637
Yeah.

1464
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:29,888
<i>You need to cut that
and the green wire</i>

1465
02:09:29,972 --> 02:09:31,974
<i>next to it simultaneously.</i>

1466
02:09:32,307 --> 02:09:33,642
Okay, ready?

1467
02:09:33,809 --> 02:09:34,810
Set?

1468
02:09:34,893 --> 02:09:35,894
Cut.

1469
02:09:37,312 --> 02:09:39,648
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1470
02:09:39,982 --> 02:09:41,984
There's nothing you can do.

1471
02:13:00,057 --> 02:13:03,143
Benji, listen. Turn the screw
counterclockwise.

1472
02:13:03,310 --> 02:13:04,311
Yep.

1473
02:13:05,437 --> 02:13:06,980
<i>Remove that panel and you'll see</i>

1474
02:13:07,064 --> 02:13:08,940
<i>the power and ground wires
for the fuse.</i>

1475
02:13:09,024 --> 02:13:10,025
Got it.

1476
02:13:10,192 --> 02:13:11,985
When the time comes,
out the green wire.

1477
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:13,695
<i>Do not cut it yet.</i>

1478
02:13:13,862 --> 02:13:14,905
Okay. We copy.

1479
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,829
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1480
02:13:23,705 --> 02:13:25,165
<i>Ethan, come in.</i>

1481
02:13:25,457 --> 02:13:28,043
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1482
02:13:28,502 --> 02:13:29,961
<i>He'll get it.</i>

1483
02:13:30,128 --> 02:13:32,547
- Yeah, but how do we know?
- He'll get it done!

1484
02:13:38,428 --> 02:13:40,514
We're out of time.
We just have to hope he has it.

1485
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:42,683
<i>- Okay, we're</i> ready.
<i>- At two seconds we cut.</i>

1486
02:13:42,849 --> 02:13:44,351
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

1487
02:13:44,518 --> 02:13:45,686
You want to cut it that close?

1488
02:13:45,769 --> 02:13:46,937
It's a second we'll never get back.

1489
02:13:47,104 --> 02:13:48,146
Can we make a decision on this?

1490
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:49,564
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1491
02:13:49,690 --> 02:13:50,691
Cutting on one?

1492
02:13:50,774 --> 02:13:51,775
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1493
02:13:54,152 --> 02:13:55,153
Three...

1494
02:13:55,737 --> 02:13:57,656
- Two...
- One.

1495
02:13:57,864 --> 02:13:58,907
Now!

1496
02:14:37,154 --> 02:14:38,822
Okay.

1497
02:14:49,583 --> 02:14:51,001
My man.

1498
02:15:37,964 --> 02:15:39,299
<i>Ethan?</i>

1499
02:15:41,635 --> 02:15:42,803
<i>Ethan?</i>

1500
02:15:43,845 --> 02:15:45,388
Can you hear me?

1501
02:15:49,226 --> 02:15:50,727
Can you hear me?

1502
02:15:54,397 --> 02:15:56,149
No. Don't, don't, don't.

1503
02:15:57,067 --> 02:15:58,401
Don't try to move.

1504
02:15:58,819 --> 02:16:01,112
Don't move.
You're pretty banged up.

1505
02:16:04,074 --> 02:16:05,909
You're a lucky man.

1506
02:16:05,992 --> 02:16:08,411
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1507
02:16:08,745 --> 02:16:10,330
If your friend didn't find you
an hour later,

1508
02:16:10,413 --> 02:16:11,540
you would've died of exposure.

1509
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,917
- My friends?
- Yeah.

1510
02:16:16,503 --> 02:16:18,505
She got here
not long after you left.

1511
02:16:19,256 --> 02:16:21,675
Right in front of half
the Indian Army.

1512
02:16:22,175 --> 02:16:24,678
Can you give us
a few minutes, please?

1513
02:16:26,596 --> 02:16:28,682
See you later, Doc.

1514
02:16:35,105 --> 02:16:36,439
Julia...

1515
02:16:37,774 --> 02:16:38,859
I'm sorry.

1516
02:16:39,693 --> 02:16:41,361
There's no reason to be sorry.

1517
02:16:41,444 --> 02:16:42,445
No.

1518
02:16:42,696 --> 02:16:44,364
I'm sorry

1519
02:16:45,615 --> 02:16:47,617
for everything. I...

1520
02:16:49,202 --> 02:16:50,537
Look at me.

1521
02:16:51,454 --> 02:16:52,789
Look at me.

1522
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,916
Look at my life.

1523
02:16:56,585 --> 02:17:00,088
I love what I do,
and I never would have

1524
02:17:00,171 --> 02:17:01,590
found this if I hadn't met you.

1525
02:17:02,757 --> 02:17:05,093
And everything that happened,

1526
02:17:05,844 --> 02:17:08,680
it taught me who I am.
It showed me

1527
02:17:08,889 --> 02:17:11,474
what I am capable of, and I...

1528
02:17:12,142 --> 02:17:13,935
I am a survivor.

1529
02:17:14,477 --> 02:17:16,146
But what happened here,

1530
02:17:17,522 --> 02:17:19,357
-it was my...
- Nothing happened.

1531
02:17:19,524 --> 02:17:21,526
Because you were here.

1532
02:17:23,612 --> 02:17:26,948
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1533
02:17:36,249 --> 02:17:37,584
You're happy?

1534
02:17:37,834 --> 02:17:39,085
<i>V9“!-</i>

1535
02:17:42,255 --> 02:17:44,674
I'm exactly where I should be.

1536
02:17:47,010 --> 02:17:48,678
And so are you.

1537
02:18:27,801 --> 02:18:29,260
<i>Per your request,</i>

1538
02:18:30,887 --> 02:18:34,808
<i>I'm handing Solomon Lane
back to MIG.</i>

1539
02:18:38,687 --> 02:18:41,189
<i>Through a broker, of course.</i>

1540
02:18:43,358 --> 02:18:46,361
<i>Part of our ongoing arrangement.</i>

1541
02:18:51,282 --> 02:18:53,535
<i>After what happened in Paris,</i>

1542
02:18:54,035 --> 02:18:56,705
<i>we prefer to keep a low profile.</i>

1543
02:18:58,707 --> 02:19:03,169
<i>And that closes your friend's account
with British Intelligence.</i>

1544
02:19:05,213 --> 02:19:07,382
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1545
02:19:07,841 --> 02:19:11,344
<i>I understand now
why Hunley believed in you.</i>

1546
02:19:12,012 --> 02:19:14,347
<i>The world needs the IMF.</i>

1547
02:19:15,015 --> 02:19:17,183
<i>We need people like you</i>

1548
02:19:17,517 --> 02:19:19,019
<i>who care about the one life</i>

1549
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:23,189
<i>as much as they care about
the millions.</i>

1550
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:26,276
<i>That way</i>

1551
02:19:26,526 --> 02:19:28,194
<i>I never have to.</i>

1552
02:19:29,029 --> 02:19:30,280
You Okay?

1553
02:19:31,448 --> 02:19:33,283
You've never looked better.

1554
02:19:33,616 --> 02:19:35,368
Don't. Please.

1555
02:19:36,286 --> 02:19:37,579
How close were we?

1556
02:19:40,457 --> 02:19:41,458
The usual.

1557
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,380
The usual?

1558
02:19:49,215 --> 02:19:50,925
Please don't make me laugh.
