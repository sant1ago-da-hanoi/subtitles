1
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,783
We get the wheels, we get la feria (the fair),

2
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,811
we keep moving on. No messing around.

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,040
You mess those wheels up this time, Chong,

4
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,074
I'm gonna have your ass.

5
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,149
Move!

6
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,017
- Right there, homes.- There's nobody, homes.

7
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,296
Where's your party, boy?

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,780
Turn down the radio.

9
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,347
You inviting the cops, too, or what?

10
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:13,487
I want El cromo (the chrome)

11
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,578
Gonna get some green

12
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,161
for this shit right here, homes.

13
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,831
Fuck.

14
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:25,169
Hey.

15
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,443
Uh, guys?

16
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,107
Those are chrome-plated lugs. You're gonna strip them.

17
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,393
Look at this guy, eh?

18
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,111
The plating flakes off.

19
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,356
Yeah?

20
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,927
You know, this is a lease. No one's gonna pay to ride...

21
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,010
Pendejo. (Asshole.)

22
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,434
Cabrón. (Dumbass.)

23
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,034
Andale pues. (Go on.)

24
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,501
Shit.

25
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,126
Come on, man.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,180
Uh, guys, guys.

27
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,517
- What the fuck?
- ¿Qué pasa? (What's up?)

28
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,233
Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this.

29
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,234
Take him out.

30
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,072
Fuck him up!

31
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,577
No! Not the car!

32
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,709
Get that puto (fag)!

33
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,086
Fuck him up, man!

34
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,550
Fuck him up!

35
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,956
Fuck him up, man!

36
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,432
Get him!

37
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,886
Hit that fool!

38
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,024
Motherfucker!

39
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,637
Shit.

40
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,873
Fuck.

41
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,285
Everyone's asleep, Burt.

42
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,207
Sleepwalking. Between the ice caps,

43
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,665
the pornographers, poisoned water, mutants...

44
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,295
it's all connected.

45
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,803
Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.

46
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,512
Why are we still talking about mutants?

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,059
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

48
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,555
Yeah, it was a good trip.

49
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,229
Killed it up and down the fence.

50
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,296
USA! USA! USA!

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,420
USA! USA!

52
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:20,655
USA! USA! USA! USA!

53
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,272
Wolverine.

54
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,227
I knew it was you.

55
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,729
- Oh, fuck.
- Please!

56
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,573
I'm in trouble!

57
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,936
You're the only one that could help!

58
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,702
Get the fuck away from me!

59
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,945
Please!

60
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,211
Logan!

61
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,461
Who was that?

62
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,463
I don't know, some crazy lady. Don't worry.

63
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,571
As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.

64
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,867
And he's a junkie now.

65
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,492
Who the fuck are you?

66
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,155
You know, you got some buckshot in your door.

67
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,038
I heard you was in Phoenix.

68
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:38,042
But then, last night, some friends of mine

69
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,286
in Texas HP called...

70
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,710
and told me they found

71
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,005
three dead cholos in a pullout on 54.

72
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,298
Not unusual, I know.

73
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,967
Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg.

74
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,564
So they was thinking...

75
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,732
it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.

76
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,308
But neither one of them can drive...

77
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,478
one being fictional, the other one extinct.

78
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,818
And since the wheel lugs they found

79
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,820
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

80
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,990
and, well...

81
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,568
this is a '24 Chrysler.

82
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,494
She found you yet?

83
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,831
Gabriela?

84
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,084
See...

85
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,749
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

86
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,338
Well, not really. I'm looking for someone

87
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,761
who's looking for you.

88
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,760
She took something of mine when I wasn't looking.

89
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,756
Something for which I am responsible.

90
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,524
Mexican lady.

91
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,386
Has her sights on you now.

92
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,231
Doesn't ring any bells?

93
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,477
I don't know any Gabriela,

94
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:43,935
so get the fuck out of my car.

95
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,744
Oh.

96
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,817
You know...

97
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,779
I know what you're hiding, amigo.

98
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,035
The old cue ball south of the border.

99
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,945
What do you want?

100
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,710
A little co-operation.

101
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,634
I'm a fan, by the way.

102
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,350
Fuck, fuck!

103
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,814
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

104
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,983
I know I said June, but I need the boat now.

105
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,649
Why would that mean the price go up?

106
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,897
Listen to me.

107
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,910
I know you wanted 70...

108
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,382
Okay, what if I could put together

109
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,406
$45,000 cash right now?

110
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,155
Hello? Hello?

111
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,447
Shit.

112
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,915
Hey, Sam.

113
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,083
Morning.

114
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,393
"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus."

115
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,063
"As well as I do know your outward favor."

116
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,522
"Well, honor is the subject of my story."

117
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,143
He's having a bad day.

118
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,690
They're all bad days.

119
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,689
He needed these six hours ago.

120
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,742
This is not enough, you know.

121
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,200
Won't see us through the week.

122
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,533
I'm working on it.

123
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,867
Your turn.

124
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,157
I've had a rough night.

125
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,467
Well, poor you.

126
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,339
In other news, he told me last night

127
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,671
he's communicating with someone.

128
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,759
He's not talking to anybody.

129
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,224
Don't be so sure.

130
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,394
He's got all these details.

131
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,103
I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier.

132
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,434
It's got them cracks in it.

133
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,769
Just please stop.

134
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,444
Bottom left.

135
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,528
You're not listening.

136
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,953
He's been asking questions again about why we're here.

137
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,783
I think he's trying to read my mind.

138
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,238
That's what these are for.

139
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,446
Eating his curds and whey

140
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,291
Then came a big spider which sat down beside her

141
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,617
And frightened Miss Muffet...

142
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,268
Friends, I have good news for you today!

143
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,812
It's not about what you do.

144
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,975
It's not about your deeds.

145
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,561
You can't live up to God's rules.

146
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,729
He knows that you can't. It's okay, we're imperfect.

147
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,492
Make way, sir.

148
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,823
I said make way!

149
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,119
The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!

150
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,624
Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!

151
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,827
And with the cheese baked right in the shell...

152
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,787
it's the next big thing!

153
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,958
Go now while supplies last!

154
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,841
Who are you?

155
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,588
You know who I am.

156
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,086
You're the man who puts me to sleep.

157
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,469
We both could use some sleep.

158
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,005
No! No! no!

159
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,643
What are you doing to me?

160
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,726
Charles.

161
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,187
Come on, now.

162
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:36,358
How long have I been here?

163
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,091
What are these?

164
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,566
You remember what they are.

165
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,510
The shots mellow the seizures.

166
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,262
The pills keep them from happening.

167
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
How about you blow on them to make them safe?

168
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,718
Fuck off, Logan.

169
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,391
So you remember who I am now.

170
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,899
I always know who you are.

171
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,562
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.

172
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:17,902
Take the pills.

173
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,449
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.

174
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,117
He doesn't listen to me.

175
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,409
I know a damn speciation when I see one.

176
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
A what?

177
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,788
Speciation. New mutant, a young one.

178
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,771
There are forces trying to kill them.

179
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,625
- Forces?
- They want help.

180
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,297
Forces, forces.

181
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,796
It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.

182
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,599
They don't want me, they want you.

183
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,136
Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.

184
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,151
They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.

185
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,574
The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago,

186
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,990
Charles, a long time.

187
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,149
There are no new mutants. Understand?

188
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,491
Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere.

189
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,118
You always thought...

190
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,947
we were part of God's plan.

191
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,833
But maybe...

192
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,498
Maybe we were God's mistake.

193
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,099
What a disappointment you are.

194
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,146
When I found you...

195
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:41,153
you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.

196
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,525
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.

197
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,945
Hooked on barbiturates.

198
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,374
You were an animal.

199
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,039
But we took you in.

200
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,833
I gave you a family.

201
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,290
And they're gone now.

202
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,384
Logan.

203
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,877
Logan...

204
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,547
What did you do?

205
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,224
What did you do?

206
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,465
Answer me! Why are we here?

207
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,388
No one should live like this.

208
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,966
Drugged in a fucking tank!

209
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,231
It's for your own good.

210
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,591
No, no, it's not!

211
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,070
You're waiting for me to die.

212
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,673
I don't wanna fight...

213
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,495
but there's things we need to discuss.

214
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,919
What things?

215
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,967
Well, would it be considered nagging...

216
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,758
if I was to repeat my previous observation...

217
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,520
that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?

218
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,268
It's what the guy gave me.

219
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,687
Wasn't in a position to make demands.

220
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,266
I almost died this morning.

221
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,002
- That seizure was...
- It was barely a minute.

222
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,171
It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe.

223
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,525
You're less affected.

224
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,526
You know he needs a higher dose.

225
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,488
And I know you got more money squirreled away.

226
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,928
That money's to get us out of here.

227
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,702
No, not us. You and him.

228
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,501
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.

229
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,004
"Sun" is the keyword.

230
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,376
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.

231
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,554
Do you?

232
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,472
Folding your underpants, and making him spotted dick.

233
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:57,844
Found this in your pocket.

234
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,888
Adamantium.

235
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,329
If you are planning to blow your brains out...

236
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,164
could you wait till you're out on the high seas?

237
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,438
I just mopped these floors.

238
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,904
I don't need this shit.

239
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,996
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

240
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,915
And God knows I've tried.

241
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,713
But I can't help you, Logan, not really...

242
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,380
if you're not gonna talk to me.

243
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,051
I hear you at night. You're not sleeping.

244
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,887
You don't wanna talk about that.

245
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,757
Or the booze you're drinking.

246
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,851
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.

247
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,940
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.

248
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,441
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

249
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,938
The ones that aren't healing.

250
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,532
And I'm pretty sure...

251
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,712
you don't wanna talk about the fact

252
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,606
that you can't read the label on that bottle.

253
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,532
It says, "Ibuprofen."

254
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,788
That was my favorite mug.

255
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,117
Stay out of my shit.

256
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,751
Something's happening to you, Logan.

257
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,497
On the inside you're sick. I can smell it.

258
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,545
Best night ever!

259
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,973
Hey, driver.

260
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,580
I love you. I love you.

261
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,414
You're such a doll.

262
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,721
Mr. Logan.

263
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:44,927
Oh, Jesus.

264
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,683
Please. We need a ride.

265
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,728
Not available. Call a cab.

266
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,992
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

267
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,162
I don't wanna know your name, lady.

268
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,646
There are men after us.

269
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,290
We need to get out of here.

270
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,024
Go north, cross to Canada.

271
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,731
Anyone can do that job.

272
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,901
I'll give you $50,000.

273
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,153
How did you find me, huh?

274
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,858
'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!

275
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,241
The people after you, they're on my ass now!

276
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,539
Sightings were posted.

277
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,753
Laura, go inside.

278
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,080
What sightings?

279
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,975
People said someone who looked like the Wolverine

280
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,999
was in El Paso, driving.

281
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,747
Said he looked old.

282
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,972
Hey!

283
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,093
I told you to stop it with that ball!

284
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,389
- Bad girl!
- No, please.

285
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,102
- I told you, bad girl!
- No, please.

286
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,364
Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that.

287
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,388
Stop, please. No.

288
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,771
Shit!

289
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,583
They're gonna have to pay for damages.

290
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,399
And she has cash.

291
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,566
I've seen it.

292
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,420
You should get your fat ass back in your office.

293
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,454
You'll get your money.

294
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,374
Don't let her call anyone, please.

295
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,583
They will find us.
They will kill us.

296
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,130
I am a nurse.

297
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,801
Was. In Mexico City.

298
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,430
When did that happen?

299
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,974
This morning. Near the border.

300
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,981
I got away from them, but...

301
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,312
...now they know my car.

302
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,403
Look, I gotta go.

303
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,779
No, wait. Please. Here.

304
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,323
Please, wait! Look.

305
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,240
Look. Here, take this. It's $20,000.

306
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,583
Here. Take us to this address.

307
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,174
You can have $30,000 more when we get there.

308
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,630
My friends there will give it to you.

309
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,587
They will be waiting.

310
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,011
They will give you anything.

311
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,302
Where did you get this?

312
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,797
My boyfriend.

313
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,311
He wants to kill me and take her.

314
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,015
And that's your daughter?

315
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Yes.

316
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,151
I know you're still good inside.

317
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,399
I know you want to help us.

318
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,506
You don't know anything about me.

319
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,530
Please!

320
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,874
I promise, there will be no problems if we leave now.

321
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,954
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

322
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,620
- We have to be there Friday.
- Or what?

323
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,368
Or we miss our chance to cross.

324
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,998
Please.

325
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,213
You have to. Please.

326
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,804
Please.

327
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,058
- I like those.
- Huh?

328
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,935
They make you look younger.

329
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,728
Charles, listen.

330
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:43,594
I gotta go...

331
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,398
I gotta go away for a few days, okay?

332
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,408
I got a long ride for some good money...

333
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,452
but when I get back, we're gonna get outta here.

334
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,534
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.

335
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,897
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.

336
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,911
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.

337
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,079
Will you be safe there?

338
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,538
Yeah. Yeah, we'll be safe.

339
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,301
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

340
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,929
Be back in a few days.

341
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,258
Shit.

342
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,009
- Logan.
- Yeah?

343
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,342
What happened?

344
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,877
Did something go wrong?

345
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,510
The job was wrong to begin with.

346
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Logan!

347
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,488
Logan!

348
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,701
What?

349
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,871
Who does this belong to?

350
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,550
Who's that?

351
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,052
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.

352
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,391
I can track mutants.

353
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,556
I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant.

354
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,385
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.

355
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:24,748
Go inside now!

356
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:35,592
You need to turn around, asshole.

357
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,072
This is private property.

358
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,450
Yes, it is.

359
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,909
In fact, I believe it belongs

360
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,576
to a multinational smelting company...

361
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,116
based in Shanghai.

362
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,959
Where are you keeping the old man? Hmm?

363
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,586
Is he over there?

364
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,415
Or is he there?

365
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,591
That'd be smart.

366
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,393
I'd like to meet him.

367
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,184
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain

368
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,305
as a weapon of mass destruction now.

369
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,769
Damn shame, what happened back east.

370
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,769
He's been dead for a year.

371
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,070
I need the girl.

372
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,284
What girl?

373
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,564
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.

374
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,622
There's no girl here.

375
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,452
I know you went to the motel.

376
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,827
Yeah, I was called there.

377
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,913
There was no girl. It was just the woman.

378
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,579
Just the woman. Such as she was.

379
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:28,403
So...

380
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,919
you saw Gabriela.

381
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,052
But...

382
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,513
you didn't call me. That hurts.

383
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,733
You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?

384
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,932
No, did you?

385
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,143
I asked you first.

386
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,394
I don't like guns.

387
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,644
Of course.

388
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,192
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

389
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,522
Like I asked.

390
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,818
See?

391
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,032
You're not the only one that's been enhanced.

392
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,954
Logan. Logan!

393
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
This is Laura.

394
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,831
Caliban, come!

395
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,792
This is who I've been telling you about.

396
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,670
This is Laura.

397
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,212
We've been waiting for you.

398
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:21,136
Hemos estando esperando por ti.
(We've been waiting for you.)

399
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,302
Come, come here.

400
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,853
It's okay.

401
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,348
Come.

402
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,061
Laura.

403
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,690
It's okay. It's okay.

404
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,068
Come. Ven aquí. (come here) Come.

405
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,316
Come. It's okay. You can stay here, Laura.

406
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,825
It's safe.

407
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,576
We can look after you here.

408
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,203
Come on.

409
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,248
Looks like ex-military. Bounty hunter, maybe?

410
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,417
Worse.

411
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,881
Is he by himself?

412
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,085
Yeah, not for long.

413
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,336
You get him back in his ride,

414
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,054
take him out to the wash and dump him.

415
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,887
What if he wakes up before I get there?

416
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,187
Text me where you are. We'll pick you up.

417
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,811
Sí. (Yes.)

418
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,007
Yes. Bien. (Okay)
Sí, sí.

419
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,031
Por supuesta...
(Of course...)

420
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,078
Logan.

421
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:32,924
- Logan!
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

422
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,036
You'll get it back after I figure out

423
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,766
what you and your mother have got us into.

424
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,130
- No, Logan.
- What?

425
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,796
I don't, I think the...

426
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,350
Logan, the woman that you met, that's not her mother.

427
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,648
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.

428
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,062
Communicating.

429
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,899
Take these now.

430
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,488
We have to get out of here. It's not safe here anymore.

431
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,814
And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?

432
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:09,115
Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about.

433
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,035
- She needs our help.
- She's not a mutant.

434
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,294
Yes, she is!

435
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,535
What's her gift, Charles?

436
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,166
Eating? Pipe throwing?

437
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,390
Logan.

438
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,301
It's okay.

439
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:20,325
Está bien.
(It's okay.)

440
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:21,449
Una choo-choo.
(A choo-choo.)

441
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:22,473
Locomotora.
(Locomotive.)

442
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:23,697
Okay, una Train.

443
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:40,822
Oh, yeah.

444
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,904
Take the gun. Dump the body.

445
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,149
Text me when you're on the way back.

446
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,561
You have anything else you need?

447
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,316
Food for the kid?

448
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,211
You're fucked now, mutie.

449
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,719
It's okay.

450
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,490
- It's the auto-train, choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.

451
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,345
It's okay. Sit down.

452
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,860
- We gotta go.
- What?

453
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,572
- What's going on? Where?
- Stay here.

454
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,192
- Don't move.
- Where are we going?

455
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,739
Hey, don't worry. He will be back for you.

456
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,616
Logan, the girl. You've got to go back for the girl.

457
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,037
Logan, what about the girl?

458
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,881
Logan.

459
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,602
Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura.

460
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,103
She's not our problem.

461
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,694
Shit! Shit!

462
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,157
Ah, shit!

463
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:41,975
Logan.

464
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,266
Yeah, I'm thinking.

465
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,479
The child.

466
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,944
Logan, we mustn't
forget Laura.

467
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,780
- Please be quiet.
- Logan.

468
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,615
Huh.

469
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,446
- Charles Xavier.
- Where's Caliban?

470
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,053
America's most wanted octogenarian.

471
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

472
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,628
Ah... Ah. Ah.

473
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,548
Where's Caliban?

474
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,195
Why don't you tell me where the girl is first?

475
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,139
Or I could ask Cue Ball. He seems quite friendly.

476
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,814
I told you, she's not here.

477
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,233
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

478
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,685
Well, I left him in the same ditch

479
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,806
he was gonna leave me in.

480
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,373
Jesus, Wolverine,

481
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,496
seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.

482
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:45,025
As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick.

483
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,837
Go get her.

484
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,078
Laura.

485
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,973
That a girl!

486
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,434
Hey, baby.

487
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,018
Laura...

488
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,021
Laura!

489
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,190
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

490
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,279
You wanna see your friends, right?

491
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,162
Command, stop.

492
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,662
You said alive or dead.

493
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,952
Laura!

494
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,621
Laura.

495
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,379
Laura.

496
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,292
No. No.

497
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,552
Move! Go!

498
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,503
Move! Go!

499
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,483
Stop shooting!

500
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,733
She heals! Move! Go!

501
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,861
Holy shit!

502
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,532
Gotcha!

503
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,250
Ah...!

504
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,963
Come on, hold her down.

505
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,643
As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.

506
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,136
Hold on!

507
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,517
Very much like you.

508
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,833
Laura, are you all right?

509
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,643
Ahh!

510
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
Move!

511
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:05,737
Hold on!

512
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,367
Fuck! Come on!

513
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:15,997
Come on!

514
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,167
Shit.

515
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,482
Fall in! Let's go!

516
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,607
Oh, watch out!

517
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:27,954
Ah!

518
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:11,776
Sit back.

519
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,540
Bring me the tracker.

520
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,047
You.

521
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,295
Who the hell are you?

522
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,641
Hey! I asked you a question. Who are you?

523
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,478
You know who she is, Logan.

524
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:43,351
No, I don't.

525
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,730
Does she remind you of anybody?

526
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:19,556
I read about you when I was a kid.

527
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,100
I believe you're thinking of someone else.

528
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,185
Hmm.

529
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:35,703
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.

530
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,908
You were helping round up all those old mutes.

531
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,118
What changed?

532
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,544
You got religion?

533
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,053
I'm gonna need you to do

534
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:51,788
one more thing for the good guys...

535
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,393
and track one more special mute for me.

536
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,766
I'm not helping you.

537
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,933
Of course, you'd say that.

538
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,481
But I got a theory that people don't really change.

539
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,396
Beware of the light.

540
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,199
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you

541
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,910
every day when you was a kid.

542
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,463
Beware of the light.

543
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:34,087
Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other.

544
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,763
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

545
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,258
She's not a natural fuck-up like you.

546
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,197
She's a business mistake, a R&D gone bad.

547
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,433
There's liability.

548
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,300
They can't have things with patents

549
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,098
running around, hurting people, can they?

550
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,019
We need to get her off the board

551
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,774
before she hurts anybody else.

552
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,529
Someone you care about, maybe.

553
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,446
So, get to sniffin'.

554
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,955
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

555
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,631
I am a nurse.

556
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,423
And for 10 years, I worked for

557
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:14,963
Transigen Research in Mexico City.

558
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,843
Transigen is owned by an American company.

559
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:24,681
What I am about to show you is illegal...

560
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:27,305
in the U.S. and Canada.

561
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:37,167
They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study.

562
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,238
But, of course, that was a lie.

563
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:42,655
These children were born in Transigen.

564
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:45,196
They were born here...

565
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,749
and have never left.

566
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,503
They have never seen the sun or the ocean...

567
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,843
rain or snow...

568
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,879
or any of God's creatures.

569
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:58,719
They have no birth certificates...

570
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:00,676
no names...

571
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,180
besides the ones we have given them.

572
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:10,193
They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls.

573
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,232
Girls no one can find anymore.

574
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:16,188
Their fathers are semillas geneticas...

575
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:17,858
special seeds in bottles.

576
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,924
- Birthday? No birth.
- Maria.

577
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:37,127
We do not dress them up for Halloween.

578
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,919
We do not call them "baby" or kiss boo-boos.

579
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:41,901
Don't think of them as children.

580
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,005
Think of them as things...

581
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:44,603
with patents and copyrights.

582
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
¿Comprende?
(Understand?)

583
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:46,814
Sí, señor.
(Yes, sir.)

584
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,176
They thought we were too poor

585
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:50,476
and stupid to understand.

586
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,063
We're poor, yes...

587
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,368
but we are not stupid.

588
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:55,556
Use your powers.

589
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:04,161
This is business.

590
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,783
They are making soldiers.

591
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,409
Killers.

592
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,463
These are babies of mutantes...

593
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,259
North Dakota.

594
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:26,427
Mmm.

595
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,763
You took that woman's money.

596
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,311
You said you would take the child there.

597
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,232
What is she?

598
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,278
She's your daughter, Logan.

599
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,455
Alkali has your genetic code.

600
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:46,614
Not just mine.

601
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:48,760
- Logan...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

602
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:49,969
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

603
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,413
- Logan...
- Just stop.

604
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,254
I have to pee.

605
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,468
Last ride.

606
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:13,022
You're welcome.

607
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,940
Stop it. For God's sake,

608
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,281
I can do this myself!

609
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,609
Yeah, well, you're not doin' it.

610
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,740
Just get on with it.

611
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,360
Not with you standing there.

612
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,120
Trust me, I'm not lookin'.

613
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,065
Hello.

614
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:04,822
Hi, there!

615
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,839
You know you gotta pay for that, right?

616
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,414
Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?

617
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,828
Come on.

618
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:17,276
That's enough. These, too.

619
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,424
Shit!

620
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:21,706
Not okay!

621
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,050
Sorry.

622
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,102
Um, do you sell phone chargers?

623
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,514
Uh...

624
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,226
Come on. Get in the car.

625
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,714
As the children became older...

626
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,919
Laura. Laura.

627
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,263
...they became more difficult.

628
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,394
They could not be controlled.

629
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,097
The company made their bodies into weapons.

630
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:22,936
Tried to teach them to kill.

631
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,315
But they did not want to fight.

632
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,900
A soldier who will not fight is useless.

633
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,949
Inside this building...

634
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,437
they are working on something new.

635
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,119
Something they think is better than the children.

636
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:43,207
Something they say is without a soul.

637
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,811
Would you like to hear my full lab report, Dr. Rice?

638
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,495
You can't get good sushi here.

639
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,803
It's the Mexican equivalent of Denver, Colorado.

640
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,733
They must have been successful.

641
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,470
About a week ago, they told us to shut our program down.

642
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,309
They started putting the children to sleep.

643
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:07,648
We are going to save as many children as we can.

644
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:10,373
I read about a place, up north.

645
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,275
A place for mutants.

646
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:13,656
They call it Eden.

647
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,300
If you are watching this...

648
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,304
it means that I am dead.

649
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:36,643
I am not sure if any other children survived.

650
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,143
We were separated.

651
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,346
There is no more money.

652
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,186
That was a lie.

653
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,234
She's not my child.

654
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,151
But I love her.

655
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,688
You may not love her.

656
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,701
But she is your child.

657
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,406
Please. I beg you...

658
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,870
take her to safety.

659
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,128
Is this where we're hiding out?

660
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:53,916
We're not hiding out.

661
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,087
We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep...

662
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:57,738
clean up, get some new clothes,

663
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,902
get a new ride and get outta here.

664
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,119
Harrah's Hotel and Casino

665
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,443
welcomes you to Oklahoma City.

666
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,015
Please keep right for valet parking.

667
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,147
Hey.

668
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,919
The fun never stops at Harrah's Hotel and Casino.

669
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,453
Hey, keep it out front, all right?

670
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,245
Come on, let's go.

671
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,358
Hey, Laura.

672
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,573
Let's go.

673
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,179
We need clothes.

674
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,706
Going up.

675
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,843
No, no, no, stop. Not a toy.

676
00:54:14,236 --> 00:54:16,553
Uh, no, no, no, no, sorry, uh, chair.

677
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:17,914
What? Okay.

678
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,166
- Push up again.- Thank you.

679
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,381
Going up.

680
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,680
Come here. Stand there. Just stand there.

681
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,760
Logan, it's yours.

682
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,910
What?

683
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:27,955
I'm not gonna wear it now.

684
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,853
Just in the room. We'll get changed in the room.

685
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,981
You're a low-down, lying Yankee.

686
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:35,229
Prove it.

687
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,657
This is a very famous picture, Laura.

688
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:48,536
It's almost 100 years old.

689
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:13,396
In life, in death, oh, Lord

690
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:18,271
Abide with me

691
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:24,322
I first saw this picture

692
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:27,006
at the Essoldo Cinema in my hometown...

693
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,235
when I was your age.

694
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:32,751
...who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name

695
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:36,294
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

696
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,262
Shit.

697
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,224
I've heard that you're a low-down,

698
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:32,966
Yankee liar.

699
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,431
Prove it.

700
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,153
You read these in your spare time?

701
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,471
Oh, yeah, Charles, we got ourselves an X-Men fan.

702
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,534
You do know they're all bullshit, right?

703
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:54,578
Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this.

704
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,930
In the real world, people die.

705
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:59,016
And no self-promoting asshole

706
00:56:59,017 --> 00:57:00,417
in a fucking leotard can stop it.

707
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,545
- This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
- Logan...

708
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,271
Her nurse has been feeding her some grade-A bullshit.

709
00:57:04,272 --> 00:57:07,052
I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence.

710
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:11,291
Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride?

711
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:14,422
Two more pills in one hour.

712
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,063
Give 'em to him.

713
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,944
Why, Shane?

714
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:21,269
A man has to be what he is, Joey.

715
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,324
Can't break the mold.

716
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,824
I tried it and it didn't work for me.

717
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:29,316
Joey, there's no living with a killing.

718
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,409
There's no going back from one.

719
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,834
Right or wrong, it's a brand.

720
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,495
A brand sticks.

721
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,999
Now you run on home to your mother,

722
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,791
and tell her everything's all right.

723
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:44,049
And there aren't any more guns in the valley.

724
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:05,942
Who are you guys?

725
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,818
More cops? 'Cause I told

726
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,319
the other guys everything that I...

727
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,577
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

728
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,419
You did your job.

729
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,800
Who the fuck is that?

730
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:46,476
Fellas.

731
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,286
Shit.

732
00:59:02,832 --> 00:59:04,172
Knock yourselves out.

733
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:07,646
I'll tell you what. Eight grand...

734
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,920
I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires...

735
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,729
mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.

736
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,051
I'll give you 10 as-is,

737
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,594
if you can forget the paperwork.

738
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:18,639
Well, you still need new tires, man, they're bald.

739
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:19,926
How long will that take?

740
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,099
An hour.

741
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:54,716
Jesus.

742
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:10,227
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

743
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,575
Sir, are the keys in... Sir!

744
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,745
You have the keys in it? Sir!

745
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,840
Shit!

746
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:56,032
Charles. Charles!

747
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,485
Argh!

748
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,330
Argh!

749
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:30,018
Going up.

750
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,542
Come on, come on.

751
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,079
Oh, shit!

752
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,453
You all right?

753
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,958
We gotta get outta here.

754
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,594
I'm so sorry.

755
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,634
I'm so sorry.

756
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,032
Emergency personnel are still on scene

757
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,663
at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City...

758
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,747
where at least 400 guests were stricken

759
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,669
with temporary paralysis yesterday.

760
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:37,428
Many are noting a similarity

761
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:39,508
to the Westchester incident over a year ago...

762
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,245
that left over 600 injured...

763
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,989
and took the lives of seven mutants,

764
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,873
including several of the X-Men.

765
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:46,054
Knock it off.

766
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,428
I said, knock it off!

767
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,176
She's a child, Logan.

768
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:56,351
And, point of fact, she's your...

769
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:58,152
How long has it been since you took your meds?

770
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:01,375
Tell me, how long has it been?

771
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:02,729
I don't know!

772
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,741
Two days.

773
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,528
You saw what happened yesterday.

774
01:05:06,529 --> 01:05:08,635
If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino...

775
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:11,083
I did what I had to do to save Laura.

776
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:12,542
You didn't do anything.

777
01:05:12,702 --> 01:05:15,122
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!

778
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:19,168
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated,

779
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,130
rambling on like a lunatic.

780
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:22,804
So much easier for you.

781
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,052
Easier? Jesus!

782
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,423
There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!

783
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,051
Yes, yes, please be like the rest of the world...

784
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:31,718
blaming someone else for your boring shit.

785
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,647
I know, Pop, I'm such a giant disappointment.

786
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:37,729
You honestly derive no sense of purpose...

787
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:38,943
from what we're doing?

788
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,653
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?

789
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,937
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.

790
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,149
Yeah, I see that.

791
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,529
And where we're taking her, there are others.

792
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:50,486
Does that mean nothing to you?

793
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,686
Yeah. Yeah, means nothing to me.

794
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,237
Especially since Nurse Gabriela...

795
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,830
made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.

796
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,656
What are you talking about?

797
01:05:58,831 --> 01:05:59,921
Give those to him, will you?

798
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,226
Take out two pills and give them to him.

799
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,750
- Logan! Logan!
- Give 'em to him.

800
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,090
Now!

801
01:06:09,608 --> 01:06:10,608
I wanna see it.

802
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,036
Dr. Rice. It's under control...

803
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,647
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

804
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:07,108
Language, Logan.

805
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,404
And you're screaming at a machine.

806
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,318
Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet,

807
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,923
she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?

808
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:15,527
She can learn to be better.

809
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,160
You mean, better than me.

810
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:19,036
Actually, yes.

811
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,958
And, by the way, Laura's foot claws...

812
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:25,714
are the obvious result of her gender, you know.

813
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,086
Is that a fact?

814
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,173
In a pride of lions, the female...

815
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:31,798
is both hunter and caregiver.

816
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,046
Good to know.

817
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:36,094
She uses her front claws for hunting...

818
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,425
and the back claws defensively.

819
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:38,513
Oh, yeah?

820
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,217
Thus, ensuring their survival.

821
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:47,652
Hey, hey!

822
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,144
We should help them.

823
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:21,845
No, we have to keep going. Someone will come along.

824
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,676
Someone has come along.

825
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,744
Alert. Alert.

826
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

827
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,374
Hey, you... uh, you need a hand?

828
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,664
Ready? Go!

829
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,680
Ah. Good, got it.

830
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,417
- Come on, let's get home.
- Laura!

831
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,014
Thank you so much for your help.

832
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:36,549
- I'm Kathryn.
- James.

833
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:37,715
This is my son, Nate.

834
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:39,093
- Hi.
- Hey.

835
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,680
That's your daughter?

836
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,505
Uh, yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...

837
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:44,934
Chuck.

838
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,057
Come on, Laura, let's go.

839
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,020
Well, can we show our appreciation

840
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:49,746
and treat the three of you to a decent meal?

841
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,060
We don't live far from here.

842
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,270
- Uh, no, thanks.
- That would be lovely!

843
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,951
My name is Dr. Rice.

844
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:05,152
But you can call me Zander if you like.

845
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,623
My colleague tells me

846
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:10,075
you've been somewhat resistant.

847
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,206
He believes you've been

848
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:14,043
dispensing delayed information...

849
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,501
to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.

850
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:20,944
I'm offering you the possibility

851
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,258
of redemption, Caliban.

852
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,217
To protect the world, and in the process,

853
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:26,556
save your friends.

854
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,984
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.

855
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,944
Unlike you, she's impure.

856
01:10:32,104 --> 01:10:33,814
She wasn't made by nature.

857
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,151
She's a mistake of my own.

858
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,399
I did what I could

859
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:37,743
and they burned me and beat me.

860
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,612
Your colleagues are savages.

861
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,494
I agree.

862
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,485
The Reavers were very ineffective.

863
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,577
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.

864
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:47,754
But I still need someone

865
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:48,972
to point us in the right direction.

866
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:50,246
No, I can't help you.

867
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,084
Breathe, breathe.

868
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,249
Now, what does he have? The old man.

869
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,168
Alzheimer's? ALS?

870
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,921
A degenerative brain disease

871
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:01,426
in the world's most dangerous brain?

872
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,339
What a combo!

873
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,310
Be nice. Now, you know we got company.

874
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,524
That's wonderful.

875
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:10,923
Everybody, have a seat.

876
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,308
Nate, sit up.

877
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,164
James, why don't you sit at the end of the table?

878
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,188
You wanna say grace? Say grace, baby.

879
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,777
Uh, thank you, God, for this food...

880
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,994
and for our new friends, the Howletts.

881
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,445
Mmm. They came to our aid.

882
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:25,985
- Amen.
- Amen.

883
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,677
- Here we go.
- Here you go, Charles.

884
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,541
Thank you, sir.

885
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:45,385
Mmm-hmm.

886
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,468
Oh, there's plenty more if she wants.

887
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,230
She's fine. Thank you.

888
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:52,472
This is delicious.

889
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:53,954
- Oh, thank you.
-  It's so good.

890
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:55,348
Where are you all headed?

891
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,901
- Oregon.
- Uh... South Dakota.

892
01:11:58,732 --> 01:11:59,732
Um...

893
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,238
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

894
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:03,743
Vacation?

895
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:04,914
Uh... Yes.

896
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,072
Uh, long overdue.

897
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,491
We're city folk.

898
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:12,079
Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country.

899
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,752
Um... And meet the people in it.

900
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,165
That sounds lovely.

901
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,423
Been trying to get Will here

902
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,043
to take a vacation for years now.

903
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,855
Oh. If we go traipsing all over the country,

904
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,023
who's gonna take care of this place?

905
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,917
Exactly. I say, let it go.

906
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,091
And live off what?

907
01:12:25,259 --> 01:12:27,009
The Lord will provide.

908
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,030
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me

909
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,264
with a new thresher.

910
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:32,391
All the same, I'd love to travel someday.

911
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,769
And I bet you will.

912
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,392
I could drop out of school.

913
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,497
Okay, let's not go that far.

914
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,611
I mean, I'll do it.

915
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:39,972
- No. No.
- Why not?

916
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,437
You wanna travel, I wanna travel.

917
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:42,525
Son. Son.

918
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,087
That sounds good to you, right?

919
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,401
This is the perfect plan.

920
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,971
Why would you want to do that, Nate?

921
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:50,318
Careful, you're speaking to a man who ran a school...

922
01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:53,122
for a lot of years. Right, Charles?

923
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,500
- Really?
- Yes, it was a...

924
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:59,718
It was a kind of special needs school. Um...

925
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,126
Uh-huh, yeah, That's a good description.

926
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,300
He was there, too.

927
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:05,465
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

928
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:06,751
I got kicked out a few times.

929
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,546
I wish I could say you were a good pupil,

930
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,926
but the words would choke me.

931
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:35,577
Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.

932
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,102
Uh, it was... it was great.

933
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,964
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...

934
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,364
But you need to rest, don't you?

935
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,057
Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.

936
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,146
The nearest one is two hours from here

937
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,250
and it's not even that nice.

938
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,511
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs

939
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:47,776
for your father and your daughter and

940
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,486
you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.

941
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,779
Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you,

942
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,013
- but we really should go.
- Logan.

943
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:54,307
We can leave early in the morning.

944
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:57,773
Break of dawn, as it were.

945
01:13:58,997 --> 01:13:59,997
Well...

946
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,439
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

947
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:03,606
Okay.

948
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,690
Sit.

949
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,640
Um...

950
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,658
Sweetie, you want some dessert?

951
01:14:10,823 --> 01:14:12,123
Two days on the road,

952
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,119
only one meal, and hardly any sleep.

953
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,334
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

954
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:18,325
Well, that's 101 reasons to keep moving.

955
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,497
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

956
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,435
And then what? We stay the night, then what?

957
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:25,959
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.

958
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,545
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

959
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:33,466
Take the pills.

960
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:38,891
Oh, shit!

961
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,061
- What's going on?
- Nate!

962
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:44,229
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.

963
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:45,728
Honey, check the sink.

964
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,319
They shut it off again.

965
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:49,629
They are just not going to let this thing go.

966
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,133
Well, you might as well handle it now.

967
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,133
It can wait till the morning. We just had rain last night.

968
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:55,715
We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.

969
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,372
All right, all right.

970
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:59,655
The pump station that supplies us

971
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,946
is a mile and a half from here.

972
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:02,876
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.

973
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,041
- By assholes.
- Hey!

974
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,209
No.

975
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:07,496
My son is happy to go with you.

976
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,421
No, no, no, that's fine.

977
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,430
The men that do this, sometimes they can be...

978
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:13,342
-I can go.
- No, you got homework.

979
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,610
All right, I'll go.

980
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:16,429
Just, uh, let me get my dad settled.

981
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:21,726
All right.

982
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,765
- I'm just saying,
- I don't care what the lawyer says.

983
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,228
But it's dangerous.

984
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,402
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

985
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,629
Want TV? There's TV here.

986
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,793
I'm fine.

987
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,050
Okay. Get some rest.

988
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:51,129
You know, Logan...

989
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:53,875
this is what life looks like.

990
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:56,931
A home, people who love each other.

991
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,255
Safe place.

992
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,970
You should take a moment and feel it.

993
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,770
Yeah. It's great.

994
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:07,478
Logan. Logan!

995
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:11,571
You still have time.

996
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:18,242
Charles, the world is not the same as it was.

997
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,331
We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.

998
01:16:23,914 --> 01:16:26,584
And where we're going, Eden...

999
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:28,839
it doesn't exist.

1000
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,923
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

1001
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,179
You understand? It's not real.

1002
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:38,933
It is for Laura.

1003
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,186
It is for Laura.

1004
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,476
Get some rest.

1005
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,945
Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here,

1006
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,198
except for us.

1007
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,993
When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain...

1008
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,777
then screwing with our water.

1009
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,285
Couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs.

1010
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,541
So, out on the highway today, those trucks...

1011
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,210
Who knows. Maybe.

1012
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:13,378
Hey, look at 'em.

1013
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:15,804
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies

1014
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,222
and tiny little brains...

1015
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:19,554
shucking their cloned-up super corn.

1016
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,040
You know it tastes like shit, too.

1017
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:22,388
Why do people eat it?

1018
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,886
They don't. They drink it. Corn syrup.

1019
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,858
It's in those drinks that everyone's having...

1020
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:30,557
to stay awake, cheer up, feel strong, sexy, whatever.

1021
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,571
Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.

1022
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,154
Mine still are.

1023
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,840
Those are for breakaway roping.

1024
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,677
Those are for barrel racing...

1025
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,929
and right here is for pole bending.

1026
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:06,928
They're all second, third place.

1027
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,730
I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me.

1028
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,406
Do you wanna listen?

1029
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:32,788
Do you like it?

1030
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,085
Um, here, you can take it for tonight...

1031
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:42,297
and I'll get it back from you in the morning.

1032
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,228
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.

1033
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:31,984
Should hold it.

1034
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:33,274
Yeah.

1035
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,110
Till next time.

1036
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:36,819
Thanks.

1037
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:41,105
Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl

1038
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,824
- been like that?
- Huh?

1039
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,356
Mute.

1040
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,488
Uh, since, uh... since the beginning.

1041
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:50,035
Mmm.

1042
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,710
Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.

1043
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:54,960
They get to be Nate's age,

1044
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,041
with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...

1045
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,301
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.

1046
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:04,224
Shit.

1047
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,388
Don't worry.

1048
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,016
We won't need it.

1049
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:12,475
Stay here.

1050
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,190
Evening, Mr. Munson.

1051
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:22,775
What brings y'all this way?

1052
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:25,324
Why don't you ask your boys?

1053
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,659
Mr. Munson,

1054
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,468
you understand you're trespassing right now, right?

1055
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:31,076
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.

1056
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,501
Huh. Bullshit.

1057
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,662
"Previous" being the operative word.

1058
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,084
Who's this?

1059
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:39,418
Just a guy telling you

1060
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,924
to get back in your nice truck.

1061
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,757
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.

1062
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,260
Hey, Carl...

1063
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:53,183
it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.

1064
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,680
Looks that way.

1065
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,271
He's a friend of mine.

1066
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,096
A friend with a big mouth.

1067
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,688
I hear that a lot.

1068
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,496
Then you probably hear this, too.

1069
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:05,609
More than I'd like.

1070
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:06,949
Then you know the drill.

1071
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,954
I'mma count to three...

1072
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,516
and you're gonna start walking away.

1073
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:12,658
I got rights to this water.

1074
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:13,872
- One.
- I have a lawyer now.

1075
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:14,964
Two.

1076
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:18,243
- Three.
- Ah. Ah.

1077
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,541
You all right, boss?

1078
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,106
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.

1079
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,130
Get the hell outta here.

1080
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,128
- You okay, boss?
- Fuck off.

1081
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,217
Go!

1082
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,738
You've had training.

1083
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:48,277
Some.

1084
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,138
Hey, don't wake her yet.

1085
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,930
Let her sleep another hour.

1086
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,017
You know, Logan...

1087
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:23,687
this was, without a doubt...

1088
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:29,816
the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.

1089
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,869
But I don't deserve it.

1090
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,041
Do I?

1091
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:48,803
I did something.

1092
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:53,888
Something unspeakable.

1093
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:03,399
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.

1094
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:11,356
This is not the first time I've hurt people.

1095
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,655
Until today, I didn't know.

1096
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:19,577
You wouldn't tell me.

1097
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:27,748
So we just kept on running away from it.

1098
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:35,885
I think I finally understand you.

1099
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,555
Logan...

1100
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,634
He's fantastic.

1101
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,126
You said you only needed the girl!

1102
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,427
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.

1103
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:14,801
Your friends had every chance.

1104
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,138
And so did you.

1105
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:18,393
Nate?

1106
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,482
Put her down.

1107
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:32,993
Honey.

1108
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,106
Stay down there, Will!

1109
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:38,449
Stop!

1110
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:40,857
Kathryn!

1111
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,638
Kathryn!

1112
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:44,002
Kathryn!

1113
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:13,534
Charles!

1114
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:15,781
Charles!

1115
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,125
Hold this.

1116
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,463
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

1117
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,048
Here he comes.

1118
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,126
I could pick him up,

1119
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,218
meet him halfway.

1120
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,845
No, no, no. Let them come to us.

1121
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,142
We struggled with the X-23s.

1122
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:44,533
We assumed, because they were children...

1123
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,993
we could raise them without a conscience.

1124
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:47,887
But you can't nurture rage.

1125
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,231
You must simply design it...

1126
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,395
from scratch.

1127
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:00,411
Who the fuck is that?

1128
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:06,578
Will Munson!

1129
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,169
Just hold on, Charles.

1130
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,921
Munson, God damn it, come out here!

1131
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:19,258
Munson!

1132
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,430
Come out here now!

1133
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,761
Come out here now, Munson.

1134
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:26,221
There's that asshole.

1135
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,556
Hello, asshole.

1136
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:32,607
Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

1137
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,769
I don't know what Munson's paying you...

1138
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,938
but Canewood can start you out at five G.

1139
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:39,609
A week, that is.

1140
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,374
You best stay where you are, pal.

1141
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:45,293
I'm the law out here.

1142
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,369
No, no, no, no, no.

1143
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,247
What in high...

1144
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,878
What? Oh, shit!

1145
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,043
Shoot him!

1146
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,126
We need to intervene.

1147
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:00,548
Well, he only listens to you, Doc.

1148
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,599
24!

1149
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:06,889
Get back here!

1150
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,144
Stop! Stop now!

1151
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:11,139
Hold this down, right now, tight!

1152
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,315
- Our boat.
- What?

1153
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,905
The Sunseeker.

1154
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,594
No.

1155
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,469
Come!

1156
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:46,798
24!

1157
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,100
- Need some help out here!
- God damn.

1158
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,619
I guess we're gonna have to take care of this now.

1159
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,163
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1160
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:54,991
Get your lily-faced ass out here!

1161
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,364
Listen to me!

1162
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,088
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1163
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,117
All right, we gotta go around that truck

1164
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:07,489
and flank them farmers.

1165
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:08,949
Follow my lead.

1166
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:10,945
Bring extra ammo, take these clips.

1167
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,077
Come!

1168
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,540
Now!

1169
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:15,714
Pick her up.

1170
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:27,722
Beware the light.

1171
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,330
What the hell are you?

1172
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:20,558
Sit down.

1173
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:41,161
Hold still.

1174
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:42,921
Hold still.

1175
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,057
Get him on the truck.

1176
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07,105
Yeah.

1177
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,034
Go.

1178
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,530
It's all right, it's all right.

1179
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,620
It's all right. You did fine, 24.

1180
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,746
You're healing. Just breathe.

1181
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:26,633
You're a newborn, by any measure.

1182
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:28,092
Just breathe.

1183
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:29,599
Your body has work to do.

1184
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,260
Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization...

1185
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,763
stromal cell proliferation.

1186
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,425
This will help you heal.

1187
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,814
Make you stronger.

1188
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:36,072
Well...

1189
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:43,874
It's got water, and...

1190
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,232
It's got water.

1191
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,408
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1192
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,513
God!

1193
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,099
Fuck! Fuck!

1194
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,267
Fuck!

1195
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:52,937
Shit!

1196
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,388
Fuck! Fuck!

1197
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:10,119
Fuck! Fuck!

1198
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:13,319
Motherfucking truck...!

1199
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:17,303
Shit!

1200
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:20,514
Fuck! Fuck!

1201
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:49,949
Welcome back.

1202
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:52,516
I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell...

1203
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,420
that nice little girl out in the waiting room...

1204
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:56,042
her daddy's gone.

1205
01:36:00,166 --> 01:36:01,166
I...

1206
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,384
I'd always hoped...

1207
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:08,636
that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.

1208
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,684
There's so few of you left.

1209
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,345
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1210
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:16,832
Ah... But I really gotta get on my way.

1211
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,066
No, no, don't do that.

1212
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:20,692
What you need is rest, and treatment.

1213
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,379
You need to check yourself in somewhere.

1214
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:23,573
I'll be fine.

1215
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:24,856
No, you're not!

1216
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,030
I mean, I know that you're different...

1217
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,440
but that doesn't change the fact

1218
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,503
that something inside you is poisoning you.

1219
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,872
You got to check yourself into a hospital.

1220
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,709
Find out what it is!

1221
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,377
I know what it is.

1222
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,587
Please, mister, if you don't wanna go to a hospital,

1223
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:43,173
maybe I can help you. Maybe I can run some tests.

1224
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:45,554
Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right?

1225
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,388
You wanna save a life, save your own.

1226
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:48,603
Forget we were here.

1227
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:49,852
Let's go.

1228
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:02,025
Hey!

1229
01:37:02,568 --> 01:37:03,568
Hey!

1230
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,089
You can't just take shit, you know.

1231
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,220
I don't know how you got me here...

1232
01:37:46,313 --> 01:37:48,683
but uh... thank you.

1233
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:49,874
De nada. (You're welcome)

1234
01:37:50,074 --> 01:37:51,244
Yeah.

1235
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,448
You can talk?

1236
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,830
You can talk?

1237
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,416
What the fuck?

1238
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:01,746
Why in the fuck...

1239
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:02,938
What's all this bullshit been

1240
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,922
for the last 2,000 fucking miles?

1241
01:38:04,946 --> 01:38:06,446
¿Tú pretendes que hable contigo
(Why do you want me to talk to you)

1242
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:07,924
si me insultas, si me gritas,
(if you're insulting me, yelling at me,)

1243
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:09,429
- What? Shut up, shut up.
- si me intentas dejar tirada? (if you try to leave me behind?)

1244
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:10,901
- Tú pretendes que abra al contigo... (why do you want me to open up with you...)
- Shut the fuck up!

1245
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:13,721
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca....

1246
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:15,696
- What? Who's that?
- Delilah, Rictor.

1247
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,360
- Jonah, Gideon
- Who is that?

1248
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,361
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor.

1249
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:23,896
North Dakota.

1250
01:38:24,858 --> 01:38:26,148
What?

1251
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,647
North Dakota, por favor. (please)

1252
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:28,948
Shit, okay. Look...

1253
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:30,199
No. Por favor.

1254
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,494
This place. Okay?

1255
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:34,789
Your nurse,

1256
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,158
she read too many stories, you understand?

1257
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:38,869
Too many stories!

1258
01:38:42,105 --> 01:38:45,669
- ¡Mira, mira lo! (Look, look at this!)
- I've seen it! I've seen it, okay?

1259
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:46,801
This all here...

1260
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:48,974
- None of this... No, no existo,
- ¡Sí, sí!

1261
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:50,049
Okay? You understand me?

1262
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:51,507
- This Eden does not exist.
- ¡Sí!

1263
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:52,967
- ¡Sí, Eden!
- No, no!

1264
01:38:53,137 --> 01:38:54,967
- Sí.
- It's a fantasy, kid. See that?

1265
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:56,157
Those are the names of the people

1266
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,981
who just made this...

1267
01:38:58,058 --> 01:38:59,848
They made this whole thing up.

1268
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:01,652
Okay? This whole...

1269
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:02,812
It happened once,

1270
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:04,735
and they just turned it into a big, fucking lie!

1271
01:39:05,266 --> 01:39:06,586
That's all this is. No!

1272
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:09,031
Fuck.

1273
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:10,992
No.

1274
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:13,368
I know, I understand.

1275
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:15,661
This is a long way.

1276
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:16,826
You understand?

1277
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:19,249
I am not taking you to North Dakota.

1278
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:25,706
I am fucked up. And I cannot get you there.

1279
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:29,008
It is a two-day drive. And I am not taking you...

1280
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,883
- Don't fucking hit me!
- ¡Vamonos! (Let's go!)

1281
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:33,051
Don't hit me!

1282
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,046
Jonah, Gideon...

1283
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:36,323
- ....Rebecca...
- Stop saying those names.

1284
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:37,447
- Delilah, Rictor.
- Right now.

1285
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:39,031
Stop saying those names.

1286
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:40,228
- Jonah, Gideon...
- Stop it!

1287
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:41,521
- Rebecca, Delilah...
- Stop!

1288
01:39:41,585 --> 01:39:44,455
- Rictor, Jonah, Gideon...
- Fuck it. Fine, fine, fine.

1289
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,191
You wanna go?

1290
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,113
I'll take you there.

1291
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,067
See for yourself.

1292
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:52,662
Let's go to fucking fantasyland.

1293
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:06,936
We understand the importance

1294
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,960
of containment, Dr. Rice.

1295
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,397
But you can't leave a war zone behind

1296
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,421
like you did in Juarez.

1297
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:11,749
Well, try to remind yourselves

1298
01:40:11,799 --> 01:40:13,193
that these are all little killing machines.

1299
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:15,236
Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.

1300
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,260
Not all.

1301
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:19,259
I was told you want these assets off-board,

1302
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,470
dead or alive.

1303
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:21,891
Are you changing my brief?

1304
01:40:22,059 --> 01:40:23,099
No.

1305
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,600
All right, then.

1306
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:27,558
Save tissue from this one.

1307
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:29,821
He's a good tracker and had a high IQ.

1308
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:36,619
Here you go.

1309
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,360
Hey.

1310
01:41:21,084 --> 01:41:22,084
Déjaki conduska.

1311
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:23,161
Hmm?

1312
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,660
Let me drive.

1313
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,631
Absolutely not.

1314
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:35,838
Quit looking at me.

1315
01:41:38,762 --> 01:41:39,762
Te estás muriendo.

1316
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:41,512
No comprende.
(Don't understand.)

1317
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,515
You are dying.

1318
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:48,854
You want to die.

1319
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:53,232
Charles told me.

1320
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,571
What else did he tell you?

1321
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:00,571
To not let you.

1322
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,551
Hey, hey, hey!

1323
01:42:21,762 --> 01:42:22,762
Rest.

1324
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,500
¡Ven aquí!
(Come over here!)

1325
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,400
¡Ven, ven aquí!
(Come, come over here!)

1326
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,854
Keep it steady.

1327
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,771
Swing him toward me.

1328
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:16,268
Yeah.

1329
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,065
Easy. Easy.

1330
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:55,976
Is this good, Rictor?

1331
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:57,635
No, not so much. Less.

1332
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:05,402
Hey!

1333
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,240
Where am I?

1334
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,790
Hey, what is it?

1335
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,464
Where did you get that?

1336
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:19,963
Where we came from.

1337
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:21,625
They gave it to us

1338
01:46:21,668 --> 01:46:22,812
when we would fight. It makes you stronger.

1339
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:24,626
It makes you crazy, is what it does.

1340
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:25,755
It'll kill you.

1341
01:46:25,839 --> 01:46:27,839
No, not if you use it in small doses.

1342
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:29,798
It's helping you heal.

1343
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:32,643
Where's Laura?

1344
01:46:32,804 --> 01:46:34,774
She's asleep down there.

1345
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:36,811
Do you want me to wake her up?

1346
01:46:44,441 --> 01:46:45,651
No.

1347
01:47:04,555 --> 01:47:06,355
Pesadilla. (Nightmare.)

1348
01:47:06,838 --> 01:47:08,548
You had a nightmare.

1349
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:14,175
Do you have nightmares?

1350
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:16,472
Sí.

1351
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:21,309
People hurt me.

1352
01:47:23,355 --> 01:47:24,855
Mine are different.

1353
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,500
¿Por qué?
(Why?)

1354
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,489
I hurt people.

1355
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,600
¿Qué es esto?
(What is this?)

1356
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,880
You know what it is.

1357
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,598
It's made out of Adamantium.

1358
01:47:56,388 --> 01:47:58,598
It's what they put inside of us.

1359
01:47:59,558 --> 01:48:01,348
That's why it can kill us.

1360
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:05,516
Probably what is killing me now.

1361
01:48:07,566 --> 01:48:08,856
Anyway...

1362
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,192
I got this a long time ago...

1363
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:16,071
and I kept it as a reminder of what I am.

1364
01:48:18,285 --> 01:48:20,245
Now I keep it to, uh...

1365
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:28,417
Actually, I-uh...

1366
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:34,132
I was thinking of shooting myself with it.

1367
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:36,259
Like Charles said.

1368
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:43,935
I've hurt people, too.

1369
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:49,768
You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.

1370
01:48:59,326 --> 01:49:01,326
They were bad people.

1371
01:49:05,123 --> 01:49:06,793
All the same.

1372
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:24,075
Not funny. That is not funny!

1373
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:27,044
Hey! Hey, pal.

1374
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:29,535
How long have I been out?

1375
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:32,447
How long have I been in that bed?

1376
01:50:32,544 --> 01:50:33,844
Two days.

1377
01:50:34,004 --> 01:50:35,314
You've been sitting here for two days?

1378
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:36,899
Hey, hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.

1379
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:38,643
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.

1380
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,545
We had to wait. It was the plan.

1381
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,049
And everyone had till today to find their way here.

1382
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:44,221
If you keep waiting,

1383
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,866
Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.

1384
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:46,930
You need to get out!

1385
01:50:47,017 --> 01:50:49,097
We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1386
01:50:49,519 --> 01:50:51,099
We're gonna cross the border.

1387
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:52,901
It's a safe haven.

1388
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:55,357
Same coordinates?

1389
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:57,735
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1390
01:50:57,902 --> 01:51:00,242
Satellites are blind then.

1391
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:01,485
Your asylum approved.

1392
01:51:02,014 --> 01:51:03,014
Copy.

1393
01:51:18,757 --> 01:51:20,427
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1394
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:25,758
A little more. Yeah.

1395
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,270
You see the woods?

1396
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:30,482
Sí.

1397
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,541
It's an eight mile hike through there.

1398
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:34,766
And you see that pass?

1399
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:36,109
Mm-hmm.

1400
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:37,404
That's the border.

1401
01:51:39,277 --> 01:51:41,107
That's where we will be safe.

1402
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:49,951
Come inside.

1403
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,335
Laura told me all that you did for her.

1404
01:51:58,797 --> 01:52:00,837
She was lucky to have you.

1405
01:52:03,301 --> 01:52:05,661
Take it. She says it's yours.

1406
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:09,678
That's why you did it, right?

1407
01:52:11,935 --> 01:52:13,685
Yeah, well...

1408
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,319
Look, I don't need it. You do, okay?

1409
01:52:17,649 --> 01:52:19,319
Suit yourself.

1410
01:52:40,964 --> 01:52:42,634
Your friends, they seem nice.

1411
01:52:42,799 --> 01:52:44,639
Kind of reminds me...

1412
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:46,970
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1413
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,470
Huh?

1414
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:51,394
You're with your pals. You made it.

1415
01:52:52,392 --> 01:52:53,892
Where will you go?

1416
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,519
Nearest bar, for starters.

1417
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,316
Hey, I got you here. That's all I signed up for.

1418
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:02,363
I even gave back the money.

1419
01:53:02,527 --> 01:53:03,567
Such a nice man.

1420
01:53:03,695 --> 01:53:05,855
Hey, I never asked for this!

1421
01:53:06,573 --> 01:53:08,373
All right? Charles never asked for this.

1422
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:10,413
Caliban never asked for this.

1423
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:13,252
And they are six feet under the ground!

1424
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,372
Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head...

1425
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:19,341
but I am not whatever it is you think I am, okay?

1426
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:23,012
I only met you, like, a week ago.

1427
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:26,175
You got your Rebecca, your Delilah...

1428
01:53:26,342 --> 01:53:28,052
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1429
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:29,849
Everything you asked for, you've got it!

1430
01:53:32,891 --> 01:53:34,771
And it is better this way.

1431
01:53:36,227 --> 01:53:38,187
Because I suck at this.

1432
01:53:39,898 --> 01:53:43,028
Bad shit happens to people I care about.

1433
01:53:43,193 --> 01:53:44,863
You understand me?

1434
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,446
Then I'll be fine.

1435
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:59,971
Run! Towards the mountains! Run!

1436
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:22,850
¡Corre!
(Run!)

1437
01:57:09,482 --> 01:57:10,782
Run, Bobby, run!

1438
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:16,947
Ah!

1439
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:36,382
Go! Go!

1440
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:38,009
Move faster!

1441
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,257
We need to reach them before they get to the border.

1442
01:58:57,089 --> 01:58:58,339
Move out!

1443
01:58:58,508 --> 01:58:59,508
Let's go, let's go!

1444
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:02,804
Run! Run!

1445
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,860
¡Corre!
Jonah! Run! Run!

1446
01:59:12,146 --> 01:59:13,686
I want you to breathe.

1447
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:15,146
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1448
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:32,455
There she is!

1449
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:33,665
We got her.

1450
01:59:36,379 --> 01:59:38,459
Back it up! Contain her.

1451
02:00:05,074 --> 02:00:06,124
Get behind me!

1452
02:00:27,638 --> 02:00:29,428
You took all the medicine.

1453
02:00:31,017 --> 02:00:32,227
It's wearing off.

1454
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,343
Go to your friends.

1455
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:02,589
Go.

1456
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:05,221
Laura.

1457
02:01:07,219 --> 02:01:08,549
You'll know when.

1458
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:21,941
Nine o'clock.

1459
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:26,236
That green juice is wearin' off, huh?

1460
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:29,779
You know, for an old mute, it's kind of a short high.

1461
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:31,792
Be hard to keep them claws out, soon.

1462
02:01:31,953 --> 02:01:33,793
Waste this dick, Logan!

1463
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:36,749
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1464
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:38,310
I'm gonna have to tell these men

1465
02:01:38,334 --> 02:01:39,384
to fire on these children.

1466
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:40,883
You don't want that.

1467
02:01:41,045 --> 02:01:43,375
You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.

1468
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:46,127
You will not survive further wounds.

1469
02:01:46,384 --> 02:01:47,934
Allow me to introduce myself.

1470
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:49,302
I'm Zander Rice.

1471
02:01:50,471 --> 02:01:52,561
I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X Program.

1472
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:56,273
Yeah. He's the asshole who put this poison in me.

1473
02:01:57,311 --> 02:01:58,771
Yes, he was one of them.

1474
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:01,939
I think I might have killed him.

1475
02:02:03,275 --> 02:02:04,395
I think you're right.

1476
02:02:04,485 --> 02:02:06,005
Why don't you show some respect, mutie?

1477
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:08,030
You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind.

1478
02:02:08,614 --> 02:02:10,934
My friend Donald overstates.

1479
02:02:11,575 --> 02:02:14,285
He makes it sound more brutal than intended.

1480
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:17,713
The goal was not to end mutant kind...

1481
02:02:17,873 --> 02:02:19,173
but to control it.

1482
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:22,423
I realized

1483
02:02:22,503 --> 02:02:24,147
we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink.

1484
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,432
That we could use those products

1485
02:02:25,456 --> 02:02:26,996
to perfect ourselves.

1486
02:02:27,425 --> 02:02:28,715
To distribute gene therapy

1487
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:30,141
discreetly through everything...

1488
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:32,512
from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.

1489
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,810
And it worked.

1490
02:02:33,973 --> 02:02:36,483
Random mutancy went the way of polio.

1491
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:37,942
We embarked on our next endeavor.

1492
02:02:38,144 --> 02:02:39,836
Growing mutants of your own.

1493
02:02:39,837 --> 02:02:42,422
- Precisely.
- Dangerous times, James. You can't...

1494
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,520
Argh!

1495
02:02:44,525 --> 02:02:45,885
Argh!

1496
02:03:01,042 --> 02:03:02,042
Showtime, boy!

1497
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:40,616
Get up, boy. Get up, boy!

1498
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:46,954
He did that. Get up!

1499
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:01,771
Laura! No!

1500
02:04:06,816 --> 02:04:07,816
Laura!

1501
02:04:55,281 --> 02:04:56,281
Please.

1502
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:32,192
Argh!

1503
02:05:39,742 --> 02:05:40,782
Go.

1504
02:05:42,578 --> 02:05:43,578
Let's go.

1505
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:45,121
Go.

1506
02:05:46,582 --> 02:05:48,082
Go, go, go!

1507
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:51,002
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1508
02:05:54,715 --> 02:05:56,835
Go. Go, go, go!

1509
02:06:01,263 --> 02:06:02,683
Go, go, go, go!

1510
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,230
Go! go!

1511
02:06:04,308 --> 02:06:05,348
Run!

1512
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:06,559
No!

1513
02:06:08,794 --> 02:06:10,254
No!

1514
02:06:46,517 --> 02:06:47,977
No, no. No.

1515
02:07:12,918 --> 02:07:14,628
Take your friends, and run.

1516
02:07:14,795 --> 02:07:16,005
No.

1517
02:07:16,714 --> 02:07:19,344
Run. They'll keep coming and coming.

1518
02:07:19,508 --> 02:07:22,178
Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.

1519
02:07:26,432 --> 02:07:28,522
Go, go.

1520
02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:38,106
Don't be what they made you.

1521
02:07:46,118 --> 02:07:48,328
Laura... Laura...

1522
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:53,880
Daddy.

1523
02:08:01,342 --> 02:08:05,762
So, this is what it feels like.

1524
02:08:08,015 --> 02:08:09,015
No!

1525
02:08:16,899 --> 02:08:17,899
No!

1526
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,930
No!

1527
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:32,710
Daddy.

1528
02:08:33,415 --> 02:08:34,415
Dad.

1529
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,700
No!

1530
02:09:06,323 --> 02:09:09,163
"A man has to be what he is, Joey."

1531
02:09:10,536 --> 02:09:12,196
"Can't break the mold."

1532
02:09:15,082 --> 02:09:17,582
"There's no living with a killing."

1533
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:20,630
"There's no going back."

1534
02:09:22,798 --> 02:09:24,678
"Right or wrong, it's a brand."

1535
02:09:25,551 --> 02:09:27,471
"A brand that sticks."

1536
02:09:30,514 --> 02:09:32,854
"Now you run on home to your mother."

1537
02:09:34,059 --> 02:09:37,519
"You tell her everything's all right."

1538
02:09:39,106 --> 02:09:42,436
"There are no more guns in the valley."

1539
02:09:59,293 --> 02:10:01,303
Let's go. We gotta move.

1540
02:11:13,027 --> 02:11:16,027
Improved by- KHALID

1541
02:11:17,204 --> 02:11:20,924
There's a man goin' 'round takin' names

1542
02:11:21,917 --> 02:11:25,747
And he decides who to free and who to blame

1543
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:30,804
Everybody won't be treated all the same

1544
02:11:32,177 --> 02:11:35,307
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down

1545
02:11:38,392 --> 02:11:40,942
When the man comes around

1546
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:48,320
The hairs on your arm will stand up

1547
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:53,241
At the terror in each sip and in each sup

1548
02:11:54,783 --> 02:11:58,123
For you partake of that last offered cup

1549
02:11:59,663 --> 02:12:03,213
Or disappear into the potter's ground

1550
02:12:05,711 --> 02:12:07,711
When the man comes around

1551
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,550
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers

1552
02:12:14,344 --> 02:12:17,474
One hundred million angels singing

1553
02:12:19,558 --> 02:12:24,228
Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum

1554
02:12:25,772 --> 02:12:28,982
Voices callin', voices cryin'

1555
02:12:30,694 --> 02:12:33,864
Some are born an' some are dyin'

1556
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:38,867
It's Alpha's and Omega's kingdom come

1557
02:12:40,037 --> 02:12:44,247
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1558
02:12:45,375 --> 02:12:48,625
The virgins are all trimming their wicks

1559
02:12:50,297 --> 02:12:54,637
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1560
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:58,757
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

1561
02:13:02,351 --> 02:13:06,021
Till Armageddon no Shalam, no Shalom

1562
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:10,937
Then the father hen will call his chickens home

1563
02:13:12,444 --> 02:13:15,614
The wise men will bow down before the throne

1564
02:13:17,324 --> 02:13:20,744
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crown

1565
02:13:23,413 --> 02:13:25,793
When the man comes around

1566
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:31,880
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still

1567
02:13:32,631 --> 02:13:36,891
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still

1568
02:13:37,177 --> 02:13:41,717
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still

1569
02:13:42,182 --> 02:13:45,352
Listen to the words long written down

1570
02:13:47,896 --> 02:13:50,226
When the man comes around

1571
02:13:51,983 --> 02:13:55,283
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers

1572
02:13:56,488 --> 02:13:59,408
One hundred million angels singin'

1573
02:14:01,827 --> 02:14:06,747
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettle drum

1574
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:11,168
Voices callin', voices cryin'

1575
02:14:12,879 --> 02:14:16,259
Some are born an' some are dyin'

1576
02:14:17,384 --> 02:14:21,724
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

1577
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:26,229
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1578
02:14:27,269 --> 02:14:30,859
The virgins are all trimming their wicks

1579
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:36,279
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

1580
02:14:36,987 --> 02:14:40,407
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

1581
02:14:41,867 --> 02:14:45,747
In measured hundredweight and penny pound

1582
02:14:47,831 --> 02:14:50,001
When the man comes around
